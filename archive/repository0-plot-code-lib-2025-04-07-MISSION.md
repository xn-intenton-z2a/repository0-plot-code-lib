# Mission Statement

_"Be a go-to plot library with a CLI, be the jq of formulae visualisations."_

This tool shall support a broad range of plotting functionalitiesâ€”from basic functions like sine, cosine, exponential, 
and logarithmic plots to advanced visualizations including enhanced spiral, polar heatmap, dual axis, box plot, 
violin plot, damped oscillation, harmonics, modulated sine, statistical summary, parametric plot, cumulative average, 
inverse function plotting, enhanced parametric plots, random walk and phyllotaxis plots,extended 3D plotting, 
enhanced exponential decay plotting functions, modulo plotting function, a scatter plot function.

**A versatile plotting tool for mathematical formula visualizations**

This library provides a command-line interface (CLI) and an integrated web interface for plotting a wide variety of 
mathematical functions including quadratic, linear, trigonometric (sine, cosine, tangent), polar, exponential, and 
logarithmic equations. The library generates multiple output formats, facilitating immediate use in workflows or web integration.
