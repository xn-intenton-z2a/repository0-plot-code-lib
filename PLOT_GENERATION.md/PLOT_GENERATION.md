# PLOT_GENERATION Feature Update

## Overview
This update enhances the existing plot generation functionality by implementing robust command-line argument parsing, detailed error handling, and improved SVG/PNG conversion processes. The changes focus on critical aspects like parsing required flags, managing multiple expressions with dynamic SVG sizing, and validating user input based on test cases and documentation guidelines.

## Functionality
- Enhance the CLI tool in src/lib/main.js to parse multiple flags (such as --expression, --range, --file, --width, --height, --output-format) reliably.
- Validate that the required flag --expression is provided and enforce --file presence when generating PNG outputs.
- Calculate proper dimensions for SVG plots, supporting single and multiple expressions with dynamic height calculation based on the number of expressions.
- Display informative error messages with timestamps for missing or invalid flag values.
- Update command-line usage examples in README.md and USAGE.md to guide users on specifying dimension flags and multiple expressions.

## Integration and Impact
- Source modifications are concentrated in src/lib/main.js for argument parsing and plot logic enhancements without adding new files.
- Update tests in tests/unit/main.test.js to verify advanced flag parsing and error conditions.
- Minimal dependency updates in package.json ensure compatibility with libraries for converting SVG to PNG as necessary.
- These updates are aligned with the mission to provide a reliable and intuitive tool for generating plots from mathematical expressions.

## Testing and Documentation
- The test suite is updated to include tests for dynamic SVG dimension calculation and error handling conditions.
- Documentation in USAGE.md and README.md is revised to include usage examples, parameter details, and error scenarios.
- This update provides a more robust user experience by thoroughly validating inputs and guiding users through proper usage.
