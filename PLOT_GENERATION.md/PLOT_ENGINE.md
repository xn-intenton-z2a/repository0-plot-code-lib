# Overview
This feature consolidates all plotting functionalities into one unified CLI tool. It merges the existing plot generation, axis labeling, style customization, dynamic SVG rendering, and PNG conversion into a single robust feature. The consolidated feature simplifies maintenance and improves usability by standardizing parameters, error handling, and documentation.

# Functionality
- Parses one or multiple mathematical expressions provided via a required flag. For multiple expressions, calculates total SVG height based on either a provided segment height or a fallback height value.
- Supports dynamic inline SVG generation with customizable dimensions (width, height, and segment height).
- Incorporates optional axis labels with non-empty values using designated parameters. The x-axis label is centered at the bottom and the y-axis label is rotated and aligned on the left side.
- Provides additional style settings (such as text color, line color, background color) and displays range information when specified.
- Implements conversion from SVG to PNG format using the sharp library when the output format flag is set, ensuring that a file output is specified.
- Enforces robust validations on required parameters (e.g., non-empty expressions, valid numeric dimensions) and logs descriptive error messages with timestamps when inputs are invalid.

# Implementation
- The main source file (src/lib/main.js) integrates CLI argument parsing, dynamic SVG rendering, axis label positioning, and optional PNG conversion.
- The SVG is constructed dynamically by combining text elements and styling attributes based on the provided flags.
- Validations for flags like --expression, --xlabel, --ylabel, and --file (for PNG conversion) are enforced consistently.
- Existing unit tests and documentation are updated to reflect the consolidated functionality under a single CLI tool.

# Testing & Documentation
- Unit tests have been updated to ensure the correctness of SVG dimensions, appropriate inclusion of axis labels, error handling for missing or invalid input, and successful PNG conversion.
- Documentation including the README and usage guides (USAGE.md) provide clear examples and explanations on how to use the consolidated CLI tool, ensuring a seamless developer experience.

# Impact
By merging previously separate features into one comprehensive module, the PLOT_ENGINE feature enhances the clarity, maintainability, and user experience of the plot-code-lib. It aligns with the mission of being the go-to tool for creating high-quality mathematical visualizations while simplifying development and support.
