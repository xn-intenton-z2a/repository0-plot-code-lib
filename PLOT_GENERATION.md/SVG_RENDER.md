# Overview
This feature introduces a minimal inline SVG rendering capability to the plot-code-lib. It transforms the user-supplied mathematical expression and options (such as range, width, and height) into a basic SVG image that represents the plot. The SVG is generated dynamically based on the provided dimensions and expression, and error messages are output when required flags are missing or invalid.

# Implementation
The main source file (src/lib/main.js) is updated to include a simple SVG generation function. When the CLI is invoked with the --expression flag, the tool parses additional flags like --range, --width, --height, and --output-format. A basic algorithm is implemented to generate an SVG tag with a placeholder path element representing the plot. This feature supports both single and multiple expressions by adjusting the SVG dimensions appropriately. The function also handles basic validation such as ensuring positive dimensions and the presence of required flags when generating PNG outputs.

# Testing
The unit tests in tests/unit/plot-generation.test.js and tests/unit/main.test.js are updated to check for:
- Correct generation of an SVG output given the appropriate flags.
- Proper error handling when required flags (such as --expression or --file for PNG output) are missing.
- Validation of numerical flags (e.g., --width and --height) to ensure that only positive numbers are processed.

# Documentation
The usage guide in USAGE.md and README.md is updated with examples demonstrating the new SVG rendering functionality. This includes examples for generating a basic SVG plot from a single expression and handling multiple expressions with dynamic dimensions. Users are guided on how to provide custom dimensions and triggers to receive a rendered plot output on the console or in a file.

This SVG rendering functionality is a core enhancement that moves the tool closer to being a complete plotting solution, in line with the mission of generating reliable mathematical visuals from a simple command line interface.
