        What's Yargs?
        
          Yargs helps you build interactive command line tools by parsing arguments and generating an elegant user interface.
        

        
          Yargs gives you:
        

        
           commands and (grouped) options (like module run -n --force),
           a dynamically generated help menu based on your arguments, 
           bash-completion shortcuts for commands and options, 
           and much more. 
        

        
          With these features, and many more, yargs allows you to focus on building your program without worrying about your args.
        

      

      

        Install
        
          Open your terminal, navigate to your project, and run using npm:
        
        
          $ npm install --save yargs
        

      
    

    
      

         Getting Started 

         After creating example.js start with the following code to get you going: 

                  
#!/usr/bin/env node

import yargs from 'yargs';
import { hideBin } from 'yargs/helpers';

yargs()
  .scriptName("pirate-parser")
  .usage('$0 <cmd> [args]')
  .command('hello [name]', 'welcome ter yargs!', (yargs) => {
    yargs.positional('name', {
      type: 'string',
      default: 'Cambi',
      describe: 'the name to say hello to'
    })
  }, function (argv) {
    console.log('hello', argv.name, 'welcome to yargs!')
  })
  .help()
  .parse(hideBin(process.argv))

          
        

         And in your terminal run: 

                  
  $ node example.js --help
          
        

         To get this output:

      Contributing
    

    

       Look through the existing issues and see if your idea is something new. 
       Create a new issue, or comment on an existing issue that you would like to help solve:
        
           it's usually best to get some feedback before proceeding to write code.
        
      

       fork the yargs repo, and clone it to your computer:
        
           GitHub has great documentation regarding writing your first pull request. 
        
      

       make sure that you write unit-test for any code that you write for yargs:
        
           we use standard coding style, which will validate your style when you run tests 

           look through our extensive test suite in /test to get an idea for how to write unit-tests for this codebase. 
        
      

       make sure you are comfortable with the Code of Conduct outlined below. 
    

    
      Contributor Code of Conduct

      experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender
      identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance,
      body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.
    

    
      Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:
    

    
       The use of sexualized language or imagery 
       Personal attacks 
       Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments 
       Public or private harassment 
       Publishing other's private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission 
       Other unethical or unprofessional conduct

      reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
      that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
      permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
      threatening, offensive, or harmful.

      Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
      reported by contacting a project maintainer at ben@npmjs.com. All
      complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
      is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. Maintainers are
      obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an
      incident.

           GitHub has great documentation regarding writing your first pull request. 
        
      

       make sure that you write unit-test for any code that you write for yargs:
        
           we use standard coding style, which will validate your style when you run tests 

           look through our extensive test suite in /test to get an idea for how to write unit-tests for this codebase.

    About 5 months ago, Mael Le Guen proposed converting the yargs codebase to TypeScript. I was a bit skeptical at first…

    I saw benefits TypeScript could offer the project:

    
      yargs has a large API surface with many implicit contracts, e.g., how calling a method like .option() eventually feeds into yargs-parser.
      some parts of the codebase are quite messy, and type safety would give additional confidence to future refactors.
    

    A few concerns were motivating my skepticism:

    
      I knew this would be a large project, and was worried we’d deliver something that was only halfway there.
      The existing @types/yargs TypeScript definitions have >12,000,000 downloads/week, I didn’t want to disrupt this community.
      I didn’t want to significantly bloat the size of yargs.
    

    Thanks to the hard work of Mael, who lead the conversion project (with help from others like QmarkC), and thanks to a few compromises, I’m happy to say that the TypeScript conversion project was successful.

    Beyond the benefits I expected (ease of refactoring, and explicit interfaces), TypeScript made two additional improvements to yargs easier, which I’m excited to announce in v16:

    
      yargs now supports both ESM and CommonJS (you can even use yargs directly in the browser, without bundling).
      yargs now has experimental support for Deno.
    

    yargs is now written in TypeScript, but…

    As the TypeScript project approached completion, it became clear that it would be significant amount of work to match the type definitions exposed in @types/yargs…

    We’ve made the decision to not ship yargs with Type declaration files. As a TypeScript user of yargs, usage instructions shouldn’t change, and you will still npm i @types/yargs --save-dev.

    Developers working on the yargs project now benefit from type safety, and the project benefits from the build steps we’ve introduced (more on this in a moment), but the existing TypeScript community should be able to upgrade with minimal disruption.

    ESM and CJS support

    yargs@v16 is ~26% larger than past version of yargs. This is because, using Node.js’ conditional exports, yargs now provides an interface for both CommonJS and ESM:

    CommonJS example:

    const {argv} = require('yargs')

if (argv.ships > 3 && argv.distance < 53.5) {
  console.log('Plunder more riffiwobbles!')
} else {
  console.log('Retreat from the xupptumblers!')
}
    

    ESM example:

    import yargs from 'yargs'
import { hideBin } from 'yargs/helpers'

yargs(hideBin(process.argv))
  .command('curl <url>', 'fetch the contents of the URL', () => {}, (argv) => {
    console.info(argv)
  })
  .demandCommand(1)
  .argv
    

    To facilitate this, we target ESM with the TypeScript compilation step, then have an additional compile step with Rollup which creates a CommonJS bundle of the library.

    It’s my hope that taking this approach of shipping a dual mode library will help smooth the process for folks experimenting with ESM (and that the additional bloat in the library will be forgiven 😊)

    Deno Support

    
      Deno is a simple, modern and secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that uses V8 and is built in Rust.
    

    Taking on the work to make yargs and its dependencies fully support ESM, combined with converting the codebase to TypeScript, made it a short addition step towards supporting the Deno runtime.

    Deno example:

    import yargs from 'https://deno.land/x/yargs/deno.ts'
import { Arguments, YargsType } from 'https://deno.land/x/yargs/types.ts'

yargs()
  .command('download <files...>', 'download a list of files', (yargs: YargsType) => {
    return yargs.positional('files', {
      describe: 'a list of files to do something with'
    })
  }, (argv: Arguments) => {
    console.info(argv)
  })
  .strictCommands()
  .demandCommand(1)
  .parse(Deno.args)
    

    I am a Deno novice, and would characterize yargs’ support of the platform as experimental. However, I’m excited to see folks adopt the functionality, and will happily fix bugs for the platform as they arise.

    Significant Breaking Changes

    
      the use of Conditional exports makes yargs’ exported files explicit. Folks who were requiring deep files, e.g., lib/utils/obj-filter.js, will not be able to do so. The helpers yargs exposes have been defined explicitly.
      the rebase helper method has been removed from yargs (this was just wrapping path.relative).
      Node 8 support has been dropped.
    

    Other changes are listed in the CHANGELOG.

    – Ben.

    As the TypeScript project approached completion, it became clear that it would be significant amount of work to match the type definitions exposed in @types/yargs…

    We’ve made the decision to not ship yargs with Type declaration files. As a TypeScript user of yargs, usage instructions shouldn’t change, and you will still npm i @types/yargs --save-dev.

    Developers working on the yargs project now benefit from type safety, and the project benefits from the build steps we’ve introduced (more on this in a moment), but the existing TypeScript community should be able to upgrade with minimal disruption.

    ESM and CJS support

    yargs@v16 is ~26% larger than past version of yargs. This is because, using Node.js’ conditional exports, yargs now provides an interface for both CommonJS and ESM:

    CommonJS example:

    const {argv} = require('yargs')

if (argv.ships > 3 && argv.distance < 53.5) {
  console.log('Plunder more riffiwobbles!')
} else {
  console.log('Retreat from the xupptumblers!')
}
    

    ESM example:

    import yargs from 'yargs'
import { hideBin } from 'yargs/helpers'

yargs(hideBin(process.argv))
  .command('curl <url>', 'fetch the contents of the URL', () => {}, (argv) => {
    console.info(argv)
  })
  .demandCommand(1)
  .argv
    

    To facilitate this, we target ESM with the TypeScript compilation step, then have an additional compile step with Rollup which creates a CommonJS bundle of the library.

    It’s my hope that taking this approach of shipping a dual mode library will help smooth the process for folks experimenting with ESM (and that the additional bloat in the library will be forgiven 😊)

    Deno Support

    
      Deno is a simple, modern and secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that uses V8 and is built in Rust.
    

    Taking on the work to make yargs and its dependencies fully support ESM, combined with converting the codebase to TypeScript, made it a short addition step towards supporting the Deno runtime.

    Deno example:

    import yargs from 'https://deno.land/x/yargs/deno.ts'
import { Arguments, YargsType } from 'https://deno.land/x/yargs/types.ts'

yargs()
  .command('download <files...>', 'download a list of files', (yargs: YargsType) => {
    return yargs.positional('files', {
      describe: 'a list of files to do something with'
    })
  }, (argv: Arguments) => {
    console.info(argv)
  })
  .strictCommands()
  .demandCommand(1)
  .parse(Deno.args)
    

    I am a Deno novice, and would characterize yargs’ support of the platform as experimental. However, I’m excited to see folks adopt the functionality, and will happily fix bugs for the platform as they arise.

    Significant Breaking Changes

    
      the use of Conditional exports makes yargs’ exported files explicit. Folks who were requiring deep files, e.g., lib/utils/obj-filter.js, will not be able to do so. The helpers yargs exposes have been defined explicitly.
      the rebase helper method has been removed from yargs (this was just wrapping path.relative).
      Node 8 support has been dropped.
    

    Other changes are listed in the CHANGELOG.

    wow, I just noticed it’s been over a year since I wrote about a release of
yargs. I’m excited about yargs@10 and I hope you’ll find it’s been worth
the wait.

    Commands are my favorite feature in yargs, they let
you quickly hammer-out a CLI-application addressing both the
problem of flow-control and human-readable help output:

      require('yargs')
  .command('append <w1> <w2>', 'append two strings', (yargs) => {}, (argv) => {
    console.log(argv.w1 + argv.w2)
  })
  .command('add <n1> <n2>', 'add two numbers', (yargs) => {}, (argv) => {
    console.log(argv.n1 + argv.n2)
  })
  .argv

    Even though I love the feature, I had a couple major beefs with the API:

    
      I like the positional argument DSL (<foo>, [bar], etc.), but positional
arguments were missing many of the features available to flag arguments:
you couldn’t set their type, configure a coerce method, etc.
      there was a major disconnect between how you described the root-level
entry-point to your application and the subcommands that your application
accepts. .usage() hadn’t ever been updated to reflect a world in-which
commands exist.
    

    The goal of yargs@10 was to address the above issues.

    .positional(<name>, <options>)

    The new .positional() method allows you to provide the same parsing hints
for positional arguments that you could already provide for flag arguments.
Let’s look at an updated version of our example application:

      require('yargs')
  .command('append <w1> <w2>', 'append two strings', (yargs) => {
    yargs.positional('w1', {
      describe: 'the left-hand word',
      type: 'string'
    }).positional('w2', {
      describe: 'the right-hand word',
      type: 'string'
    })
  }, (argv) => {
    console.log(argv.w1 + argv.w2)
  })
  .command('add <n1> <n2>', 'add two numbers', (yargs) => {
    yargs.positional('n1', {
      describe: 'the left-hand number',
      type: 'number'
    }).positional('n2', {
      describe: 'the right-hand number',
      type: 'number'
    })
  }, (argv) => {
    console.log(argv.n1 + argv.n2)
  })
  .argv

    To provide parsing hints for positional arguments, simply use the method
.positional() in your command’s builder function. Positional arguments
now go through the same parser that parses flag arguments and behavior
will be identical.

    .usage(<cmd>, [description], [builder], [handler])

    If you provide more than one argument to the .usage() method, .usage()
now acts as an alias for a default command. This allows you to configure a command
that runs as the main entry-point to your application.

    Let’s look at an example:

      require('yargs')
  .usage('$0 <name>', 'say hello', (yargs) => {
    yargs.positional('name', {
      describe: 'the person to say hello to',
      type: 'string'
    })
  }, (argv) => {
    console.info(`hello ${argv.name}`)
  })
  .argv

    You can now use the same powerful command DSL for
describing the root-entry point to your application as you use for subcommands!

    Upgrading

    There have been a couple breaking changes in this release:

    
      .usage() previously accepted an object as a second argument, treating this
as an alias for .option([obj]).
      the API for defining hidden options has been made more explicit; rather than
a falsy description representing a hidden option, the configuration value
hidden: true should be set.
      help is now only shown if help is the last positional argument.
    

    For a complete list of changes, see our CHANGELOG.md

    I hope you like what yargs@10 has to offer,

for positional arguments that you could already provide for flag arguments.
Let’s look at an updated version of our example application:

      require('yargs')
  .command('append <w1> <w2>', 'append two strings', (yargs) => {
    yargs.positional('w1', {
      describe: 'the left-hand word',
      type: 'string'
    }).positional('w2', {
      describe: 'the right-hand word',
      type: 'string'
    })
  }, (argv) => {
    console.log(argv.w1 + argv.w2)
  })
  .command('add <n1> <n2>', 'add two numbers', (yargs) => {
    yargs.positional('n1', {
      describe: 'the left-hand number',
      type: 'number'
    }).positional('n2', {
      describe: 'the right-hand number',
      type: 'number'
    })
  }, (argv) => {
    console.log(argv.n1 + argv.n2)
  })
  .argv

    To provide parsing hints for positional arguments, simply use the method
.positional() in your command’s builder function. Positional arguments
now go through the same parser that parses flag arguments and behavior
will be identical.

    .usage(<cmd>, [description], [builder], [handler])

    If you provide more than one argument to the .usage() method, .usage()
now acts as an alias for a default command. This allows you to configure a command
that runs as the main entry-point to your application.

    Let’s look at an example:

      require('yargs')
  .usage('$0 <name>', 'say hello', (yargs) => {
    yargs.positional('name', {
      describe: 'the person to say hello to',
      type: 'string'
    })
  }, (argv) => {
    console.info(`hello ${argv.name}`)
  })
  .argv

    You can now use the same powerful command DSL for
describing the root-entry point to your application as you use for subcommands!

    Upgrading

    There have been a couple breaking changes in this release:

    
      .usage() previously accepted an object as a second argument, treating this
as an alias for .option([obj]).
      the API for defining hidden options has been made more explicit; rather than
a falsy description representing a hidden option, the configuration value
hidden: true should be set.
      help is now only shown if help is the last positional argument.

    I hope you like what yargs@10 has to offer,

    – Ben.\nwow, I just noticed it’s been over a year since I wrote about a release of
yargs. I’m excited about yargs@10 and I hope you’ll find it’s been worth
the wait.\nCommands are my favorite feature in yargs, they let
you quickly hammer-out a CLI-application addressing both the
problem of flow-control and human-readable help output:\nEven though I love the feature, I had a couple major beefs with the API:\nI like the positional argument DSL (<foo>, [bar], etc.), but positional
arguments were missing many of the features available to flag arguments:
you couldn’t set their type, configure a coerce method, etc.\npositional argument DSL\nthere was a major disconnect between how you described the root-level
entry-point to your application and the subcommands that your application
accepts. .usage() hadn’t ever been updated to reflect a world in-which
commands exist.\nThe goal of yargs@10 was to address the above issues.\n.positional(<name>, <options>)\nThe new .positional() method allows you to provide the same parsing hints
for positional arguments that you could already provide for flag arguments.
Let’s look at an updated version of our example application:\nTo provide parsing hints for positional arguments, simply use the method

          Docs\nyargs 5.0.0 Released

    yargs 5.0.0 is currently published to the next tag. To try it out simply
 type the following:

    npm cache clear; npm i yargs@next --save

    This release is an exciting one: we’ve both introduced several slick new
features (command suggestions, option coercion); and taken the opportunity presented by a major release to cleanup
inconsistencies with yargs’ underlying API.

    New Features

    Recommended Commands

    I love how git’s command-line-interface provides helpful suggestions when
you accidentally type the wrong command:

      git: 'comit' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.

Did you mean this?
	commit

    With the new recommendCommands() method, you can add this same functionality
to your yargs applications:

      require('yargs')
  .command('hello', 'hello command')
  .command('goodbye', 'goodbye command')
  .recommendCommands()
  .argv

      $ ./cli.js helo

Commands:
  hello    hello command
  goodbye  goodbye command

Did you mean hello?

    Option Coercion

    yargs allows you to provide a type parameter for your options, hinting how the value
should be interpreted, e.g., array, boolean, string.

    This works great for simple values, but folks routinely ask for more complex
parsing options; as an example, people have asked for the ability to parse
JSON:

    $ ./cli.js -j '{"message": "hello world!"}'

    yargs’ new coercion feature allows you to apply an arbitrary
parsing function to your options:

    var argv = require('./')
  .option('j', {
    alias: 'json',
    coerce: function (arg) {
      return JSON.parse(arg)
    }
  })
  .argv

console.log(argv.json.message)

    $ ./cli.js '{"message": "hello world!"}'

hello world!

    I love the concept of coercion, it gives our users much more flexibility
when parsing their arguments; without adding any significant complexity to
yargs itself.

    Breaking Changes

    yargs 5.0.0 introduces several breaking changes, read carefully!

    Fixes to Command API

    yargs’ command API is a great way to build a complex nested command
line application; in a nutshell, it allows you to decompose your
command line application into individual commands, helping with the
separation of concerns:

    require('yargs')
  .command('foo', 'foo command', function (yargs) {
    // builder function, receives a yargs instance
    // which you can use to add command-specific options.
  }, function (argv) {
    // handler function, called once parsing is complete.
    console.log('foo')
  })
  .command('bar', 'bar command', {}, function (argv) {
    console.log('bar')
  })
  .argv

    slick!

    Commands are one of yargs’ most complex features, and we continue
to iterate on their API; we’ve made the following command-related breaking changes
in this release:

    
      default help command added: you can now
simply type ./cli.js help, to receive yargs’ help output.
      changes to demand(): demand() now properly
handles being invoked relative to a command; before this fix, the command itself would cause
constraints to be applied incorrectly.
      builder no longer requires yargs to be returned: The third
argument to command is a builder for describing options specific to the command. The builder command no longer requires that you
return a yargs instance. Simply interact with the yargs instance passed as the first argument, and your options
will take effect.
      builder now defaults to noop builder: the builder
now resets all yargs configuration settings that are not flagged as being global.
      global fail: the fail() method now applies globally. This means that
you can define a fail() handler once on the top-level yargs object, and nested failures in commands will bubble up to it.
    

    Tweaks to Parser

    yargs-parser is the underlying engine that
processes the strings passed into  process.argv.

    We’ve made a couple breaking changes to the parser in this release:

    
      we now handle negative numbers: prior to
this release negative numbers were interpreted as numeric options, with this
release you can now pass negative numbers as values to options: -number -123.
      fixes to option groups: a bug has been
fixed with option groups (-abc) terminated by numeric values (-abc123).
    

    Miscellaneous

    
      fixed name of Chinese locale: we’ve renamed
zh.json to zh_CN.json
    

    What’s Next

    The biggest thing currently on the core team’s mind is documentation. The yargs README has grown unwieldy! we have some plans in the
works to help solve this problem:

    
      over the next few months expect to see targeted tutorials popping up on the yargs
website; the first of which will likely be on the topic of commands.
      we’ve also created a gitter.im chatroom where folks can get help using yargs from its core contributors.
    

    Hope you enjoy all the exciting updates in yargs 5.0.0!

when parsing their arguments; without adding any significant complexity to
yargs itself.

    Breaking Changes

    yargs 5.0.0 introduces several breaking changes, read carefully!

    Fixes to Command API

    yargs’ command API is a great way to build a complex nested command
line application; in a nutshell, it allows you to decompose your
command line application into individual commands, helping with the
separation of concerns:

    require('yargs')
  .command('foo', 'foo command', function (yargs) {
    // builder function, receives a yargs instance
    // which you can use to add command-specific options.
  }, function (argv) {
    // handler function, called once parsing is complete.
    console.log('foo')
  })
  .command('bar', 'bar command', {}, function (argv) {
    console.log('bar')
  })
  .argv

    slick!

    Commands are one of yargs’ most complex features, and we continue
to iterate on their API; we’ve made the following command-related breaking changes
in this release:

    
      default help command added: you can now
simply type ./cli.js help, to receive yargs’ help output.
      changes to demand(): demand() now properly
handles being invoked relative to a command; before this fix, the command itself would cause
constraints to be applied incorrectly.
      builder no longer requires yargs to be returned: The third
argument to command is a builder for describing options specific to the command. The builder command no longer requires that you
return a yargs instance. Simply interact with the yargs instance passed as the first argument, and your options
will take effect.
      builder now defaults to noop builder: the builder
now resets all yargs configuration settings that are not flagged as being global.
      global fail: the fail() method now applies globally. This means that
you can define a fail() handler once on the top-level yargs object, and nested failures in commands will bubble up to it.
    

    Tweaks to Parser

    yargs-parser is the underlying engine that
processes the strings passed into  process.argv.

    We’ve made a couple breaking changes to the parser in this release:

    
      we now handle negative numbers: prior to
this release negative numbers were interpreted as numeric options, with this
release you can now pass negative numbers as values to options: -number -123.
      fixes to option groups: a bug has been
fixed with option groups (-abc) terminated by numeric values (-abc123).
    

    Miscellaneous

    
      fixed name of Chinese locale: we’ve renamed
zh.json to zh_CN.json
    

    What’s Next

    The biggest thing currently on the core team’s mind is documentation. The yargs README has grown unwieldy! we have some plans in the
works to help solve this problem:

    
      over the next few months expect to see targeted tutorials popping up on the yargs
website; the first of which will likely be on the topic of commands.
      we’ve also created a gitter.im chatroom where folks can get help using yargs from its core contributors.
    

    Hope you enjoy all the exciting updates in yargs 5.0.0!

    I’m excited to announce that yargs 4.0 is here and it’s a big update!

    I had a few major goals for this update:

    
      fix some long standing API inconsistencies.
      improve support for commands (this feature never felt quite right).
      modularize more of yargs’ components.
      begin moving yargs into an organization.
    

    Breaking Changes

    There a few breaking changes that you should be mindful of as you
upgrade from yargs 3.x to yargs 4.x:

    .help()

    When called with no arguments in 3.x, help would return a string representation of
the usage string that yargs would output. This felt inconsistent with
other API methods (.env(), .completion()), which simply use a default
option name when called with no arguments.

    Calling .help() with no arguments will now default to enabling help
when --help is passed to your CLI application.

    .command()

    There has been a major overhaul to the command API (which I will be discussing
  in its own section).

    .version()

    .version() took its arguments in
the opposite order to other API methods: version #, followed by key.

    .version() now takes arguments in an API consistent order: key, followed by version #. Calling version with no arguments will now default to using the --version key,
and outputting the version # read from your package.json.

    .strict()

    strict mode will now require that any commands executed have been
registered using .command().

    But Wait, There’s More! Exciting New Features

    .pkgConf(key, cwd)

    The new .pkgConf() feature allows you to specify that yargs should load
default configuration values from a key in your package.json, e.g.,:

      
  require('yargs')
    .pkgConf('nyc')
  


    Would load the default reporter value from:

      
  {
    "name": "nyc",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "nyc": {
      "reporter": "lcov"
    }
  }
  


    Configure The Yargs Parser

    You can now turn on and off various features in the yargs parser:

    
      short-option-groups
      camel-case-expansion
      dot-notation
      parse-numbers
      boolean-negation
    

    To do so create a yargs stanza in your project’s package.json:

      
  {
    "name": "nyc",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "yargs": {
      "short-option-groups": false,
      "boolean-negation": false
    }
  }
  


    See the Configuration Documentation of the
yargs-parser project, for more information about these various parsing settings.

    .number(‘foo’)

    The new number type has been added to yargs, this works similar to string and
boolean.

    

    Commands 2.0

    Commands always felt a bit clunky in yargs 3.x, I found myself creating a
lot of boiler plate code.

    yargs 4.x includes several updates to help solve this problem:

    Named Positional Arguments

    When creating a command you can now specify optional and required
positional arguments:

      
  yargs.command('get <source> [proxy]', 'make a get HTTP request')
    .help()
    .argv
  


    The above code creates a get command, with the required source
argument, and the optional proxy argument.

    These positional arguments will be populated in argv, like so:

      
  {
    "_": ["get"]
    "source": "the-source-you-entered",
    "proxy": "the-proxy-address-you-entered"
  }
  


    Builders and Handlers

    For building a complex command-line interface, yargs now allows you to
specify a builder, and a handler:

    builders allow you to specify what arguments a sub-command
should accept.

    handlers are invoked with the parsed argv object, if a command is
triggered.

    This design makes it easy to pull your commands into their own modules:

    my-module.js:

      
  // my-module.js
  exports.builder = {
    banana: {
      default: 'cool'
    },
    batman: {
      default: 'sad'
    }
  }

  exports.handler = function (argv) {
    // do something with argv.
  }
  


    my-bin.js:

      
  yargs.command('get <source> [proxy]', 'make a get HTTP request', require('my-module'))
    .help(
    .argv
  


    Global Options

    Globals make defining the options that commands accept less repetitive.
Global options will not be reset when
invoking a sub-command. Commands like help() and version() default to being
global. What does this mean?

    If I write:

      
  yargs.command('get <source> [proxy]', 'make a get HTTP request', require('my-module'))
    .help()
    .argv
  


    Calling:

    my-bin get --help

    will return help specific to the get command, without me needing to redeclare this fact.

    Yargs is More Modular

    As part of the move to yargs 4.x, yargs has been split into more modules:

    
      yargs — yargs core.
      yargs-parser — the part of yargs that actually parses argv.
      y18n — yargs’ i18n library.
      cliui — yargs’ CLI layout library.
    

    Yargs is Moving Into An Organization

    One final big announcement, yargs’ is being moved into an organization. What does this mean?

    There’s a Website

    There is now a beautiful new website which Irina Shestak has
been leading development on:

    http://yargs.js.org/

    There Are More Contributors

    The yargs’ libraries are being moved into a GitHub organization, and several core contributors have been added:

    
      Ben Coe
      Andrew Goode
      Irina Shestak
      Max Rittmüller
    

    There’s a New Logo

    A special thanks to James Womack and Chris Dickinson, who helped create a beautiful logo for the organization.

    Read The Contributor Guidelines

    In an effort to ensure that yargs is a project that is inviting to
new developers, and creates a safe environment for folks to work in, a
contributor’s code of conduct has been added:

    http://yargs.js.org/contributing/

    Thank you to everyone who has made the yargs project possible, I couldn’t
be more excited about the future \o/

    We got stickers!

    

    Order on StickerMule.\nYargs 4.0 is Here

    I’m excited to announce that yargs 4.0 is here and it’s a big update!

    I had a few major goals for this update:

    
      fix some long standing API inconsistencies.
      improve support for commands (this feature never felt quite right).
      modularize more of yargs’ components.
      begin moving yargs into an organization.
    

    Breaking Changes

    There a few breaking changes that you should be mindful of as you
upgrade from yargs 3.x to yargs 4.x:

    .help()

    When called with no arguments in 3.x, help would return a string representation of
the usage string that yargs would output. This felt inconsistent with
other API methods (.env(), .completion()), which simply use a default
option name when called with no arguments.

    Calling .help() with no arguments will now default to enabling help
when --help is passed to your CLI application.

    .command()

    There has been a major overhaul to the command API (which I will be discussing
  in its own section).

    .version()

    .version() took its arguments in
the opposite order to other API methods: version #, followed by key.

    .version() now takes arguments in an API consistent order: key, followed by version #. Calling version with no arguments will now default to using the --version key,
and outputting the version # read from your package.json.

    .strict()

    strict mode will now require that any commands executed have been
registered using .command().

    But Wait, There’s More! Exciting New Features

    .pkgConf(key, cwd)

    The new .pkgConf() feature allows you to specify that yargs should load
default configuration values from a key in your package.json, e.g.,:

      
  require('yargs')
    .pkgConf('nyc')
  


    Would load the default reporter value from:

      
  {
    "name": "nyc",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "nyc": {
      "reporter": "lcov"
    }
  }
  


    Configure The Yargs Parser

    You can now turn on and off various features in the yargs parser:

    
      short-option-groups
      camel-case-expansion
      dot-notation
      parse-numbers
      boolean-negation
    

    To do so create a yargs stanza in your project’s package.json:

      
  {
    "name": "nyc",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "yargs": {
      "short-option-groups": false,
      "boolean-negation": false
    }
  }
  


    See the Configuration Documentation of the
yargs-parser project, for more information about these various parsing settings.

    .number(‘foo’)

    The new number type has been added to yargs, this works similar to string and
boolean.

    

    Commands 2.0

    Commands always felt a bit clunky in yargs 3.x, I found myself creating a
lot of boiler plate code.

    yargs 4.x includes several updates to help solve this problem:

    Named Positional Arguments

    When creating a command you can now specify optional and required
positional arguments:

      
  yargs.command('get <source> [proxy]', 'make a get HTTP request')
    .help()
    .argv
  


    The above code creates a get command, with the required source
argument, and the optional proxy argument.

    These positional arguments will be populated in argv, like so:

      
  {
    "_": ["get"]
    "source": "the-source-you-entered",
    "proxy": "the-proxy-address-you-entered"
  }
  


    Builders and Handlers

    For building a complex command-line interface, yargs now allows you to
specify a builder, and a handler:

    builders allow you to specify what arguments a sub-command
should accept.

    handlers are invoked with the parsed argv object, if a command is
triggered.

    This design makes it easy to pull your commands into their own modules:

    my-module.js:

      
  // my-module.js
  exports.builder = {
    banana: {
      default: 'cool'
    },
    batman: {
      default: 'sad'
    }
  }

  exports.handler = function (argv) {
    // do something with argv.
  }
  


    my-bin.js:

      
  yargs.command('get <source> [proxy]', 'make a get HTTP request', require('my-module'))
    .help(
    .argv
  


    Global Options

    Globals make defining the options that commands accept less repetitive.
Global options will not be reset when
invoking a sub-command. Commands like help() and version() default to being
global. What does this mean?

    If I write:

      
  yargs.command('get <source> [proxy]', 'make a get HTTP request', require('my-module'))
    .help()
    .argv
  


    Calling:

    my-bin get --help

    will return help specific to the get command, without me needing to redeclare this fact.

    Yargs is More Modular

    As part of the move to yargs 4.x, yargs has been split into more modules:

    
      yargs — yargs core.
      yargs-parser — the part of yargs that actually parses argv.
      y18n — yargs’ i18n library.
      cliui — yargs’ CLI layout library.

    One final big announcement, yargs’ is being moved into an organization. What does this mean?

    There is now a beautiful new website which Irina Shestak has

      camel-case-expansion
      dot-notation
      parse-numbers
      boolean-negation
    

    To do so create a yargs stanza in your project’s package.json:

      
  {
    "name": "nyc",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "yargs": {
      "short-option-groups": false,
      "boolean-negation": false
    }
  }
  


    See the Configuration Documentation of the
yargs-parser project, for more information about these various parsing settings.

    .number(‘foo’)

    The new number type has been added to yargs, this works similar to string and
boolean.

    

    Commands 2.0

    Commands always felt a bit clunky in yargs 3.x, I found myself creating a
lot of boiler plate code.

    yargs 4.x includes several updates to help solve this problem:

    Named Positional Arguments

    When creating a command you can now specify optional and required
positional arguments:

      
  yargs.command('get <source> [proxy]', 'make a get HTTP request')
    .help()
    .argv
  


    The above code creates a get command, with the required source
argument, and the optional proxy argument.

    These positional arguments will be populated in argv, like so:

      
  {
    "_": ["get"]
    "source": "the-source-you-entered",
    "proxy": "the-proxy-address-you-entered"
  }
  


    Builders and Handlers

    For building a complex command-line interface, yargs now allows you to
specify a builder, and a handler:

    builders allow you to specify what arguments a sub-command
should accept.

    handlers are invoked with the parsed argv object, if a command is
triggered.

    This design makes it easy to pull your commands into their own modules:

    my-module.js:

      
  // my-module.js
  exports.builder = {
    banana: {
      default: 'cool'
    },
    batman: {
      default: 'sad'
    }
  }

  exports.handler = function (argv) {
    // do something with argv.
  }
  


    my-bin.js:

      
  yargs.command('get <source> [proxy]', 'make a get HTTP request', require('my-module'))
    .help(
    .argv
  


    Global Options

    Globals make defining the options that commands accept less repetitive.
Global options will not be reset when
invoking a sub-command. Commands like help() and version() default to being
global. What does this mean?

    If I write:

      
  yargs.command('get <source> [proxy]', 'make a get HTTP request', require('my-module'))
    .help()
    .argv
  


    Calling:

    my-bin get --help

    will return help specific to the get command, without me needing to redeclare this fact.

    Yargs is More Modular

    As part of the move to yargs 4.x, yargs has been split into more modules:

    
      yargs — yargs core.
      yargs-parser — the part of yargs that actually parses argv.
      y18n — yargs’ i18n library.
      cliui — yargs’ CLI layout library.
    

    Yargs is Moving Into An Organization

    One final big announcement, yargs’ is being moved into an organization. What does this mean?

    There’s a Website

    There is now a beautiful new website which Irina Shestak has
been leading development on:

    http://yargs.js.org/

    There Are More Contributors

    The yargs’ libraries are being moved into a GitHub organization, and several core contributors have been added:

    
      Ben Coe
      Andrew Goode
      Irina Shestak
      Max Rittmüller
    

    There’s a New Logo

    We got stickers!

    

    Order on StickerMule.\nYargs 4.0 is Here

    I’m excited to announce that yargs 4.0 is here and it’s a big update!

    I had a few major goals for this update:

    
      fix some long standing API inconsistencies.
      improve support for commands (this feature never felt quite right).
      modularize more of yargs’ components.
      begin moving yargs into an organization.
    

    Breaking Changes

    There a few breaking changes that you should be mindful of as you
upgrade from yargs 3.x to yargs 4.x:

    .help()

    When called with no arguments in 3.x, help would return a string representation of
the usage string that yargs would output. This felt inconsistent with
other API methods (.env(), .completion()), which simply use a default
option name when called with no arguments.

    Calling .help() with no arguments will now default to enabling help
when --help is passed to your CLI application.

    .command()

    There has been a major overhaul to the command API (which I will be discussing
  in its own section).

    .version()

    .version() took its arguments in
the opposite order to other API methods: version #, followed by key.

    .version() now takes arguments in an API consistent order: key, followed by version #. Calling version with no arguments will now default to using the --version key,
and outputting the version # read from your package.json.

    .strict()

    strict mode will now require that any commands executed have been
registered using .command().

    But Wait, There’s More! Exciting New Features

    .pkgConf(key, cwd)

    The new .pkgConf() feature allows you to specify that yargs should load
default configuration values from a key in your package.json, e.g.,:

      
  require('yargs')
    .pkgConf('nyc')
  


    Would load the default reporter value from:

      
  {
    "name": "nyc",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "nyc": {
      "reporter": "lcov"
    }
  }
  


    Configure The Yargs Parser

    You can now turn on and off various features in the yargs parser:

    
      short-option-groups
      camel-case-expansion
      dot-notation
      parse-numbers
      boolean-negation
    

    To do so create a yargs stanza in your project’s package.json:

      
  {
    "name": "nyc",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "yargs": {
      "short-option-groups": false,
      "boolean-negation": false
    }

should accept.\nhandlers are invoked with the parsed argv object, if a command is
triggered.\nThis design makes it easy to pull your commands into their own modules:\nGlobals make defining the options that commands accept less repetitive.
Global options will not be reset when
invoking a sub-command. Commands like help() and version() default to being
global. What does this mean?\nwill return help specific to the get command, without me needing to redeclare this fact.\nYargs is More Modular\nAs part of the move to yargs 4.x, yargs has been split into more modules:\nyargs-parser — the part of yargs that actually parses argv.\ny18n — yargs’ i18n library.\ncliui — yargs’ CLI layout library.\nYargs is Moving Into An Organization\nOne final big announcement, yargs’ is being moved into an organization. What does this mean?\nThere is now a beautiful new website which Irina Shestak has
been leading development on:\nThere Are More Contributors\nThe yargs’ libraries are being moved into a GitHub organization, and several core contributors have been added:\nA special thanks to James Womack and Chris Dickinson, who helped create a beautiful logo for the organization.\nRead The Contributor Guidelines\nIn an effort to ensure that yargs is a project that is inviting to
new developers, and creates a safe environment for folks to work in, a
contributor’s code of conduct has been added:\nhttp://yargs.js.org/contributing/\nhttp://yargs.js.org/contributing/\nThank you to everyone who has made the yargs project possible, I couldn’t
be more excited about the future \o/\nWe got stickers!

        What's Yargs?
        
          Yargs helps you build interactive command line tools by parsing arguments and generating an elegant user interface.
        

        
          Yargs gives you:
        

        
           commands and (grouped) options (like module run -n --force),
           a dynamically generated help menu based on your arguments, 
           bash-completion shortcuts for commands and options, 
           and much more. 
        

        
          With these features, and many more, yargs allows you to focus on building your program without worrying about your args.
        

      

      

        Install
        
          Open your terminal, navigate to your project, and run using npm:
        
        
          $ npm install --save yargs
        

      
    

    
      

         Getting Started 

         After creating example.js start with the following code to get you going: 

                  
#!/usr/bin/env node

import yargs from 'yargs';
import { hideBin } from 'yargs/helpers';

yargs()
  .scriptName("pirate-parser")
  .usage('$0 <cmd> [args]')
  .command('hello [name]', 'welcome ter yargs!', (yargs) => {
    yargs.positional('name', {
      type: 'string',
      default: 'Cambi',
      describe: 'the name to say hello to'
    })
  }, function (argv) {
    console.log('hello', argv.name, 'welcome to yargs!')
  })
  .help()
  .parse(hideBin(process.argv))

          
        

         And in your terminal run: 

                  
  $ node example.js --help
          
        

         To get this output:

       Look through the existing issues and see if your idea is something new. 
       Create a new issue, or comment on an existing issue that you would like to help solve:
        
           it's usually best to get some feedback before proceeding to write code.
        
      

       fork the yargs repo, and clone it to your computer:
        
           GitHub has great documentation regarding writing your first pull request. 
        
      

       make sure that you write unit-test for any code that you write for yargs:
        
           we use standard coding style, which will validate your style when you run tests 

           look through our extensive test suite in /test to get an idea for how to write unit-tests for this codebase.

    About 5 months ago, Mael Le Guen proposed converting the yargs codebase to TypeScript. I was a bit skeptical at first…

    I saw benefits TypeScript could offer the project:

    
      yargs has a large API surface with many implicit contracts, e.g., how calling a method like .option() eventually feeds into yargs-parser.
      some parts of the codebase are quite messy, and type safety would give additional confidence to future refactors.
    

    A few concerns were motivating my skepticism:

    
      I knew this would be a large project, and was worried we’d deliver something that was only halfway there.
      The existing @types/yargs TypeScript definitions have >12,000,000 downloads/week, I didn’t want to disrupt this community.
      I didn’t want to significantly bloat the size of yargs.
    

    Thanks to the hard work of Mael, who lead the conversion project (with help from others like QmarkC), and thanks to a few compromises, I’m happy to say that the TypeScript conversion project was successful.

    Beyond the benefits I expected (ease of refactoring, and explicit interfaces), TypeScript made two additional improvements to yargs easier, which I’m excited to announce in v16:

    
      yargs now supports both ESM and CommonJS (you can even use yargs directly in the browser, without bundling).
      yargs now has experimental support for Deno.
    

    yargs is now written in TypeScript, but…

    As the TypeScript project approached completion, it became clear that it would be significant amount of work to match the type definitions exposed in @types/yargs…

    We’ve made the decision to not ship yargs with Type declaration files. As a TypeScript user of yargs, usage instructions shouldn’t change, and you will still npm i @types/yargs --save-dev.

    Developers working on the yargs project now benefit from type safety, and the project benefits from the build steps we’ve introduced (more on this in a moment), but the existing TypeScript community should be able to upgrade with minimal disruption.

    ESM and CJS support

    yargs@v16 is ~26% larger than past version of yargs. This is because, using Node.js’ conditional exports, yargs now provides an interface for both CommonJS and ESM:

    CommonJS example:

    const {argv} = require('yargs')

if (argv.ships > 3 && argv.distance < 53.5) {
  console.log('Plunder more riffiwobbles!')
} else {
  console.log('Retreat from the xupptumblers!')
}
    

    ESM example:

    import yargs from 'yargs'
import { hideBin } from 'yargs/helpers'

yargs(hideBin(process.argv))
  .command('curl <url>', 'fetch the contents of the URL', () => {}, (argv) => {
    console.info(argv)
  })
  .demandCommand(1)
  .argv
    

    To facilitate this, we target ESM with the TypeScript compilation step, then have an additional compile step with Rollup which creates a CommonJS bundle of the library.

    It’s my hope that taking this approach of shipping a dual mode library will help smooth the process for folks experimenting with ESM (and that the additional bloat in the library will be forgiven 😊)

    Deno Support

    
      Deno is a simple, modern and secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that uses V8 and is built in Rust.
    

    Taking on the work to make yargs and its dependencies fully support ESM, combined with converting the codebase to TypeScript, made it a short addition step towards supporting the Deno runtime.

    Deno example:

    import yargs from 'https://deno.land/x/yargs/deno.ts'
import { Arguments, YargsType } from 'https://deno.land/x/yargs/types.ts'

yargs()
  .command('download <files...>', 'download a list of files', (yargs: YargsType) => {
    return yargs.positional('files', {
      describe: 'a list of files to do something with'
    })
  }, (argv: Arguments) => {
    console.info(argv)
  })
  .strictCommands()
  .demandCommand(1)
  .parse(Deno.args)
    

    I am a Deno novice, and would characterize yargs’ support of the platform as experimental. However, I’m excited to see folks adopt the functionality, and will happily fix bugs for the platform as they arise.

    Significant Breaking Changes

    
      the use of Conditional exports makes yargs’ exported files explicit. Folks who were requiring deep files, e.g., lib/utils/obj-filter.js, will not be able to do so. The helpers yargs exposes have been defined explicitly.
      the rebase helper method has been removed from yargs (this was just wrapping path.relative).
      Node 8 support has been dropped.
    

    Other changes are listed in the CHANGELOG.

    – Ben.

      “How my team releases libraries”.\nyargs 16 Released

    About 5 months ago, Mael Le Guen proposed converting the yargs codebase to TypeScript. I was a bit skeptical at first…

    I saw benefits TypeScript could offer the project:

    
      yargs has a large API surface with many implicit contracts, e.g., how calling a method like .option() eventually feeds into yargs-parser.
      some parts of the codebase are quite messy, and type safety would give additional confidence to future refactors.
    

    A few concerns were motivating my skepticism:

    
      I knew this would be a large project, and was worried we’d deliver something that was only halfway there.
      The existing @types/yargs TypeScript definitions have >12,000,000 downloads/week, I didn’t want to disrupt this community.
      I didn’t want to significantly bloat the size of yargs.
    

    Thanks to the hard work of Mael, who lead the conversion project (with help from others like QmarkC), and thanks to a few compromises, I’m happy to say that the TypeScript conversion project was successful.

    Beyond the benefits I expected (ease of refactoring, and explicit interfaces), TypeScript made two additional improvements to yargs easier, which I’m excited to announce in v16:

    
      yargs now supports both ESM and CommonJS (you can even use yargs directly in the browser, without bundling).
      yargs now has experimental support for Deno.
    

    yargs is now written in TypeScript, but…

    As the TypeScript project approached completion, it became clear that it would be significant amount of work to match the type definitions exposed in @types/yargs…

    We’ve made the decision to not ship yargs with Type declaration files. As a TypeScript user of yargs, usage instructions shouldn’t change, and you will still npm i @types/yargs --save-dev.

    Developers working on the yargs project now benefit from type safety, and the project benefits from the build steps we’ve introduced (more on this in a moment), but the existing TypeScript community should be able to upgrade with minimal disruption.

    ESM and CJS support

    yargs@v16 is ~26% larger than past version of yargs. This is because, using Node.js’ conditional exports, yargs now provides an interface for both CommonJS and ESM:

    CommonJS example:

    const {argv} = require('yargs')

if (argv.ships > 3 && argv.distance < 53.5) {
  console.log('Plunder more riffiwobbles!')
} else {
  console.log('Retreat from the xupptumblers!')
}
    

    ESM example:

    import yargs from 'yargs'
import { hideBin } from 'yargs/helpers'

yargs(hideBin(process.argv))
  .command('curl <url>', 'fetch the contents of the URL', () => {}, (argv) => {
    console.info(argv)
  })
  .demandCommand(1)
  .argv
    

    To facilitate this, we target ESM with the TypeScript compilation step, then have an additional compile step with Rollup which creates a CommonJS bundle of the library.

    It’s my hope that taking this approach of shipping a dual mode library will help smooth the process for folks experimenting with ESM (and that the additional bloat in the library will be forgiven 😊)

    Deno Support

    
      Deno is a simple, modern and secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that uses V8 and is built in Rust.
    

    Taking on the work to make yargs and its dependencies fully support ESM, combined with converting the codebase to TypeScript, made it a short addition step towards supporting the Deno runtime.

    Deno example:

    import yargs from 'https://deno.land/x/yargs/deno.ts'
import { Arguments, YargsType } from 'https://deno.land/x/yargs/types.ts'

yargs()
  .command('download <files...>', 'download a list of files', (yargs: YargsType) => {
    return yargs.positional('files', {
      describe: 'a list of files to do something with'
    })
  }, (argv: Arguments) => {
    console.info(argv)
  })
  .strictCommands()
  .demandCommand(1)
  .parse(Deno.args)
    

    I am a Deno novice, and would characterize yargs’ support of the platform as experimental. However, I’m excited to see folks adopt the functionality, and will happily fix bugs for the platform as they arise.

    Significant Breaking Changes

    
      the use of Conditional exports makes yargs’ exported files explicit. Folks who were requiring deep files, e.g., lib/utils/obj-filter.js, will not be able to do so. The helpers yargs exposes have been defined explicitly.
      the rebase helper method has been removed from yargs (this was just wrapping path.relative).
      Node 8 support has been dropped.
    

    Other changes are listed in the CHANGELOG.

    wow, I just noticed it’s been over a year since I wrote about a release of
yargs. I’m excited about yargs@10 and I hope you’ll find it’s been worth
the wait.

    Commands are my favorite feature in yargs, they let
you quickly hammer-out a CLI-application addressing both the
problem of flow-control and human-readable help output:

      require('yargs')
  .command('append <w1> <w2>', 'append two strings', (yargs) => {}, (argv) => {
    console.log(argv.w1 + argv.w2)
  })
  .command('add <n1> <n2>', 'add two numbers', (yargs) => {}, (argv) => {
    console.log(argv.n1 + argv.n2)
  })
  .argv

    Even though I love the feature, I had a couple major beefs with the API:

    
      I like the positional argument DSL (<foo>, [bar], etc.), but positional
arguments were missing many of the features available to flag arguments:
you couldn’t set their type, configure a coerce method, etc.
      there was a major disconnect between how you described the root-level
entry-point to your application and the subcommands that your application
accepts. .usage() hadn’t ever been updated to reflect a world in-which
commands exist.
    

    The goal of yargs@10 was to address the above issues.

    .positional(<name>, <options>)

    The new .positional() method allows you to provide the same parsing hints
for positional arguments that you could already provide for flag arguments.
Let’s look at an updated version of our example application:

      require('yargs')
  .command('append <w1> <w2>', 'append two strings', (yargs) => {
    yargs.positional('w1', {
      describe: 'the left-hand word',
      type: 'string'
    }).positional('w2', {
      describe: 'the right-hand word',
      type: 'string'
    })
  }, (argv) => {
    console.log(argv.w1 + argv.w2)
  })
  .command('add <n1> <n2>', 'add two numbers', (yargs) => {
    yargs.positional('n1', {
      describe: 'the left-hand number',
      type: 'number'
    }).positional('n2', {
      describe: 'the right-hand number',
      type: 'number'
    })
  }, (argv) => {
    console.log(argv.n1 + argv.n2)
  })
  .argv

    To provide parsing hints for positional arguments, simply use the method
.positional() in your command’s builder function. Positional arguments
now go through the same parser that parses flag arguments and behavior
will be identical.

    .usage(<cmd>, [description], [builder], [handler])

    If you provide more than one argument to the .usage() method, .usage()
now acts as an alias for a default command. This allows you to configure a command
that runs as the main entry-point to your application.

    Let’s look at an example:

      require('yargs')
  .usage('$0 <name>', 'say hello', (yargs) => {
    yargs.positional('name', {
      describe: 'the person to say hello to',
      type: 'string'
    })
  }, (argv) => {
    console.info(`hello ${argv.name}`)
  })
  .argv

    You can now use the same powerful command DSL for
describing the root-entry point to your application as you use for subcommands!

    Upgrading

    There have been a couple breaking changes in this release:

    
      .usage() previously accepted an object as a second argument, treating this
as an alias for .option([obj]).
      the API for defining hidden options has been made more explicit; rather than
a falsy description representing a hidden option, the configuration value
hidden: true should be set.
      help is now only shown if help is the last positional argument.
    

    For a complete list of changes, see our CHANGELOG.md

    I hope you like what yargs@10 has to offer,

    – Ben.\nyargs 10 Released

    wow, I just noticed it’s been over a year since I wrote about a release of
yargs. I’m excited about yargs@10 and I hope you’ll find it’s been worth
the wait.

    Commands are my favorite feature in yargs, they let
you quickly hammer-out a CLI-application addressing both the
problem of flow-control and human-readable help output:

      require('yargs')
  .command('append <w1> <w2>', 'append two strings', (yargs) => {}, (argv) => {
    console.log(argv.w1 + argv.w2)
  })
  .command('add <n1> <n2>', 'add two numbers', (yargs) => {}, (argv) => {
    console.log(argv.n1 + argv.n2)
  })
  .argv

    Even though I love the feature, I had a couple major beefs with the API:

    
      I like the positional argument DSL (<foo>, [bar], etc.), but positional
arguments were missing many of the features available to flag arguments:
you couldn’t set their type, configure a coerce method, etc.
      there was a major disconnect between how you described the root-level
entry-point to your application and the subcommands that your application
accepts. .usage() hadn’t ever been updated to reflect a world in-which
commands exist.
    

    The goal of yargs@10 was to address the above issues.

    .positional(<name>, <options>)

    The new .positional() method allows you to provide the same parsing hints
for positional arguments that you could already provide for flag arguments.
Let’s look at an updated version of our example application:

      require('yargs')
  .command('append <w1> <w2>', 'append two strings', (yargs) => {
    yargs.positional('w1', {
      describe: 'the left-hand word',
      type: 'string'
    }).positional('w2', {
      describe: 'the right-hand word',
      type: 'string'
    })
  }, (argv) => {
    console.log(argv.w1 + argv.w2)
  })
  .command('add <n1> <n2>', 'add two numbers', (yargs) => {
    yargs.positional('n1', {
      describe: 'the left-hand number',
      type: 'number'
    }).positional('n2', {
      describe: 'the right-hand number',
      type: 'number'
    })
  }, (argv) => {
    console.log(argv.n1 + argv.n2)
  })
  .argv

    To provide parsing hints for positional arguments, simply use the method
.positional() in your command’s builder function. Positional arguments
now go through the same parser that parses flag arguments and behavior
will be identical.

    .usage(<cmd>, [description], [builder], [handler])

    If you provide more than one argument to the .usage() method, .usage()
now acts as an alias for a default command. This allows you to configure a command
that runs as the main entry-point to your application.

    Let’s look at an example:

      require('yargs')
  .usage('$0 <name>', 'say hello', (yargs) => {
    yargs.positional('name', {
      describe: 'the person to say hello to',
      type: 'string'
    })
  }, (argv) => {
    console.info(`hello ${argv.name}`)
  })
  .argv

    You can now use the same powerful command DSL for
describing the root-entry point to your application as you use for subcommands!

    Upgrading

    There have been a couple breaking changes in this release:

    
      .usage() previously accepted an object as a second argument, treating this
as an alias for .option([obj]).
      the API for defining hidden options has been made more explicit; rather than
a falsy description representing a hidden option, the configuration value
hidden: true should be set.
      help is now only shown if help is the last positional argument.

          Docs\nyargs 5.0.0 Released

    yargs 5.0.0 is currently published to the next tag. To try it out simply
 type the following:

    npm cache clear; npm i yargs@next --save

    This release is an exciting one: we’ve both introduced several slick new
features (command suggestions, option coercion); and taken the opportunity presented by a major release to cleanup
inconsistencies with yargs’ underlying API.

    New Features

    Recommended Commands

    I love how git’s command-line-interface provides helpful suggestions when
you accidentally type the wrong command:

      git: 'comit' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.

Did you mean this?
	commit

    With the new recommendCommands() method, you can add this same functionality
to your yargs applications:

      require('yargs')
  .command('hello', 'hello command')
  .command('goodbye', 'goodbye command')
  .recommendCommands()
  .argv

      $ ./cli.js helo

Commands:
  hello    hello command
  goodbye  goodbye command

Did you mean hello?

    Option Coercion

    yargs allows you to provide a type parameter for your options, hinting how the value
should be interpreted, e.g., array, boolean, string.

    This works great for simple values, but folks routinely ask for more complex
parsing options; as an example, people have asked for the ability to parse
JSON:

    $ ./cli.js -j '{"message": "hello world!"}'

    yargs’ new coercion feature allows you to apply an arbitrary
parsing function to your options:

    var argv = require('./')
  .option('j', {
    alias: 'json',
    coerce: function (arg) {
      return JSON.parse(arg)
    }
  })
  .argv

console.log(argv.json.message)

    $ ./cli.js '{"message": "hello world!"}'

hello world!

    I love the concept of coercion, it gives our users much more flexibility
when parsing their arguments; without adding any significant complexity to
yargs itself.

    Breaking Changes

    yargs 5.0.0 introduces several breaking changes, read carefully!

    Fixes to Command API

    yargs’ command API is a great way to build a complex nested command
line application; in a nutshell, it allows you to decompose your
command line application into individual commands, helping with the
separation of concerns:

    require('yargs')
  .command('foo', 'foo command', function (yargs) {
    // builder function, receives a yargs instance
    // which you can use to add command-specific options.
  }, function (argv) {
    // handler function, called once parsing is complete.
    console.log('foo')
  })
  .command('bar', 'bar command', {}, function (argv) {
    console.log('bar')
  })
  .argv

    slick!

    Commands are one of yargs’ most complex features, and we continue
to iterate on their API; we’ve made the following command-related breaking changes
in this release:

    
      default help command added: you can now
simply type ./cli.js help, to receive yargs’ help output.
      changes to demand(): demand() now properly
handles being invoked relative to a command; before this fix, the command itself would cause
constraints to be applied incorrectly.
      builder no longer requires yargs to be returned: The third
argument to command is a builder for describing options specific to the command. The builder command no longer requires that you
return a yargs instance. Simply interact with the yargs instance passed as the first argument, and your options
will take effect.
      builder now defaults to noop builder: the builder
now resets all yargs configuration settings that are not flagged as being global.
      global fail: the fail() method now applies globally. This means that
you can define a fail() handler once on the top-level yargs object, and nested failures in commands will bubble up to it.
    

    Tweaks to Parser

    yargs-parser is the underlying engine that
processes the strings passed into  process.argv.

    We’ve made a couple breaking changes to the parser in this release:

    
      we now handle negative numbers: prior to
this release negative numbers were interpreted as numeric options, with this
release you can now pass negative numbers as values to options: -number -123.
      fixes to option groups: a bug has been
fixed with option groups (-abc) terminated by numeric values (-abc123).
    

    Miscellaneous

    
      fixed name of Chinese locale: we’ve renamed
zh.json to zh_CN.json
    

    What’s Next

    The biggest thing currently on the core team’s mind is documentation. The yargs README has grown unwieldy! we have some plans in the
works to help solve this problem:

    
      over the next few months expect to see targeted tutorials popping up on the yargs
website; the first of which will likely be on the topic of commands.
      we’ve also created a gitter.im chatroom where folks can get help using yargs from its core contributors.
    

    Hope you enjoy all the exciting updates in yargs 5.0.0!

inconsistencies with yargs’ underlying API.

    New Features

    Recommended Commands

    I love how git’s command-line-interface provides helpful suggestions when
you accidentally type the wrong command:

      git: 'comit' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.

Did you mean this?
	commit

    With the new recommendCommands() method, you can add this same functionality
to your yargs applications:

      require('yargs')
  .command('hello', 'hello command')
  .command('goodbye', 'goodbye command')
  .recommendCommands()
  .argv

      $ ./cli.js helo

Commands:
  hello    hello command
  goodbye  goodbye command

Did you mean hello?

    Option Coercion

    yargs allows you to provide a type parameter for your options, hinting how the value
should be interpreted, e.g., array, boolean, string.

    This works great for simple values, but folks routinely ask for more complex
parsing options; as an example, people have asked for the ability to parse
JSON:

    $ ./cli.js -j '{"message": "hello world!"}'

    yargs’ new coercion feature allows you to apply an arbitrary
parsing function to your options:

    var argv = require('./')
  .option('j', {
    alias: 'json',
    coerce: function (arg) {
      return JSON.parse(arg)
    }
  })
  .argv

console.log(argv.json.message)

    $ ./cli.js '{"message": "hello world!"}'

hello world!

    I love the concept of coercion, it gives our users much more flexibility
when parsing their arguments; without adding any significant complexity to
yargs itself.

    Breaking Changes

    yargs 5.0.0 introduces several breaking changes, read carefully!

    Fixes to Command API

    yargs’ command API is a great way to build a complex nested command
line application; in a nutshell, it allows you to decompose your
command line application into individual commands, helping with the
separation of concerns:

    require('yargs')
  .command('foo', 'foo command', function (yargs) {
    // builder function, receives a yargs instance
    // which you can use to add command-specific options.
  }, function (argv) {
    // handler function, called once parsing is complete.
    console.log('foo')
  })
  .command('bar', 'bar command', {}, function (argv) {
    console.log('bar')
  })
  .argv

    slick!

    Commands are one of yargs’ most complex features, and we continue
to iterate on their API; we’ve made the following command-related breaking changes
in this release:

    
      default help command added: you can now
simply type ./cli.js help, to receive yargs’ help output.
      changes to demand(): demand() now properly
handles being invoked relative to a command; before this fix, the command itself would cause
constraints to be applied incorrectly.
      builder no longer requires yargs to be returned: The third
argument to command is a builder for describing options specific to the command. The builder command no longer requires that you
return a yargs instance. Simply interact with the yargs instance passed as the first argument, and your options
will take effect.
      builder now defaults to noop builder: the builder
now resets all yargs configuration settings that are not flagged as being global.
      global fail: the fail() method now applies globally. This means that
you can define a fail() handler once on the top-level yargs object, and nested failures in commands will bubble up to it.
    

    Tweaks to Parser

    yargs-parser is the underlying engine that
processes the strings passed into  process.argv.

    We’ve made a couple breaking changes to the parser in this release:

    
      we now handle negative numbers: prior to
this release negative numbers were interpreted as numeric options, with this
release you can now pass negative numbers as values to options: -number -123.
      fixes to option groups: a bug has been
fixed with option groups (-abc) terminated by numeric values (-abc123).
    

    Miscellaneous

    
      fixed name of Chinese locale: we’ve renamed
zh.json to zh_CN.json
    

    What’s Next

    The biggest thing currently on the core team’s mind is documentation. The yargs README has grown unwieldy! we have some plans in the
works to help solve this problem:

    
      over the next few months expect to see targeted tutorials popping up on the yargs
website; the first of which will likely be on the topic of commands.
      we’ve also created a gitter.im chatroom where folks can get help using yargs from its core contributors.
    

    Hope you enjoy all the exciting updates in yargs 5.0.0!

    I’m excited to announce that yargs 4.0 is here and it’s a big update!

    I had a few major goals for this update:

    
      fix some long standing API inconsistencies.
      improve support for commands (this feature never felt quite right).
      modularize more of yargs’ components.
      begin moving yargs into an organization.
    

    Breaking Changes

    There a few breaking changes that you should be mindful of as you
upgrade from yargs 3.x to yargs 4.x:

    .help()

    When called with no arguments in 3.x, help would return a string representation of
the usage string that yargs would output. This felt inconsistent with
other API methods (.env(), .completion()), which simply use a default
option name when called with no arguments.

    Calling .help() with no arguments will now default to enabling help
when --help is passed to your CLI application.

    .command()

    There has been a major overhaul to the command API (which I will be discussing
  in its own section).

    .version()

    .version() took its arguments in
the opposite order to other API methods: version #, followed by key.

    .version() now takes arguments in an API consistent order: key, followed by version #. Calling version with no arguments will now default to using the --version key,
and outputting the version # read from your package.json.

    .strict()

    strict mode will now require that any commands executed have been
registered using .command().

    But Wait, There’s More! Exciting New Features

    .pkgConf(key, cwd)

    The new .pkgConf() feature allows you to specify that yargs should load
default configuration values from a key in your package.json, e.g.,:

      
  require('yargs')
    .pkgConf('nyc')
  


    Would load the default reporter value from:

      
  {
    "name": "nyc",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "nyc": {
      "reporter": "lcov"
    }
  }
  


    Configure The Yargs Parser

    You can now turn on and off various features in the yargs parser:

    
      short-option-groups
      camel-case-expansion
      dot-notation
      parse-numbers
      boolean-negation
    

    To do so create a yargs stanza in your project’s package.json:

      
  {
    "name": "nyc",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "yargs": {
      "short-option-groups": false,
      "boolean-negation": false
    }
  }
  


    See the Configuration Documentation of the
yargs-parser project, for more information about these various parsing settings.

    .number(‘foo’)

    The new number type has been added to yargs, this works similar to string and
boolean.

    

    Commands 2.0

    Commands always felt a bit clunky in yargs 3.x, I found myself creating a
lot of boiler plate code.

    yargs 4.x includes several updates to help solve this problem:

    Named Positional Arguments

    When creating a command you can now specify optional and required
positional arguments:

      
  yargs.command('get <source> [proxy]', 'make a get HTTP request')
    .help()
    .argv
  


    The above code creates a get command, with the required source
argument, and the optional proxy argument.

    These positional arguments will be populated in argv, like so:

      
  {
    "_": ["get"]
    "source": "the-source-you-entered",
    "proxy": "the-proxy-address-you-entered"
  }
  


    Builders and Handlers

    For building a complex command-line interface, yargs now allows you to
specify a builder, and a handler:

    builders allow you to specify what arguments a sub-command
should accept.

    handlers are invoked with the parsed argv object, if a command is
triggered.

    This design makes it easy to pull your commands into their own modules:

    my-module.js:

      
  // my-module.js
  exports.builder = {
    banana: {
      default: 'cool'
    },
    batman: {
      default: 'sad'
    }
  }

  exports.handler = function (argv) {
    // do something with argv.
  }
  


    my-bin.js:

      
  yargs.command('get <source> [proxy]', 'make a get HTTP request', require('my-module'))
    .help(
    .argv
  


    Global Options

    Globals make defining the options that commands accept less repetitive.
Global options will not be reset when
invoking a sub-command. Commands like help() and version() default to being
global. What does this mean?

    If I write:

      
  yargs.command('get <source> [proxy]', 'make a get HTTP request', require('my-module'))
    .help()
    .argv
  


    Calling:

    my-bin get --help

    will return help specific to the get command, without me needing to redeclare this fact.

    Yargs is More Modular

    As part of the move to yargs 4.x, yargs has been split into more modules:

    
      yargs — yargs core.
      yargs-parser — the part of yargs that actually parses argv.
      y18n — yargs’ i18n library.
      cliui — yargs’ CLI layout library.
    

    Yargs is Moving Into An Organization

    One final big announcement, yargs’ is being moved into an organization. What does this mean?

    There’s a Website

    There is now a beautiful new website which Irina Shestak has
been leading development on:

    http://yargs.js.org/

    There Are More Contributors

    The yargs’ libraries are being moved into a GitHub organization, and several core contributors have been added:

    
      Ben Coe
      Andrew Goode
      Irina Shestak
      Max Rittmüller
    

    There’s a New Logo

    A special thanks to James Womack and Chris Dickinson, who helped create a beautiful logo for the organization.

    Read The Contributor Guidelines

    In an effort to ensure that yargs is a project that is inviting to
new developers, and creates a safe environment for folks to work in, a
contributor’s code of conduct has been added:

    Thank you to everyone who has made the yargs project possible, I couldn’t
be more excited about the future \o/

    Yargs is Moving Into An Organization

    One final big announcement, yargs’ is being moved into an organization. What does this mean?

    There’s a Website

    There is now a beautiful new website which Irina Shestak has
been leading development on:

    http://yargs.js.org/

    There Are More Contributors

    The yargs’ libraries are being moved into a GitHub organization, and several core contributors have been added:

    
      Ben Coe
      Andrew Goode
      Irina Shestak
      Max Rittmüller

    We got stickers!

    

    Order on StickerMule.\nYargs 4.0 is Here

    I’m excited to announce that yargs 4.0 is here and it’s a big update!

    I had a few major goals for this update:

    
      fix some long standing API inconsistencies.
      improve support for commands (this feature never felt quite right).
      modularize more of yargs’ components.
      begin moving yargs into an organization.
    

    Breaking Changes

    There a few breaking changes that you should be mindful of as you
upgrade from yargs 3.x to yargs 4.x:

    .help()

    When called with no arguments in 3.x, help would return a string representation of
the usage string that yargs would output. This felt inconsistent with
other API methods (.env(), .completion()), which simply use a default
option name when called with no arguments.

    Calling .help() with no arguments will now default to enabling help
when --help is passed to your CLI application.

    .command()

    There has been a major overhaul to the command API (which I will be discussing
  in its own section).

    .version()

    .version() took its arguments in
the opposite order to other API methods: version #, followed by key.

    .version() now takes arguments in an API consistent order: key, followed by version #. Calling version with no arguments will now default to using the --version key,
and outputting the version # read from your package.json.

    .strict()

    strict mode will now require that any commands executed have been
registered using .command().

    But Wait, There’s More! Exciting New Features

    .pkgConf(key, cwd)

    The new .pkgConf() feature allows you to specify that yargs should load
default configuration values from a key in your package.json, e.g.,:

      
  require('yargs')
    .pkgConf('nyc')
  


    Would load the default reporter value from:

      
  {
    "name": "nyc",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "nyc": {
      "reporter": "lcov"
    }
  }
  


    Configure The Yargs Parser

    You can now turn on and off various features in the yargs parser:

    
      short-option-groups
      camel-case-expansion
      dot-notation
      parse-numbers
      boolean-negation
    

    To do so create a yargs stanza in your project’s package.json:

      
  {
    "name": "nyc",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "yargs": {
      "short-option-groups": false,
      "boolean-negation": false
    }
  }
  


    See the Configuration Documentation of the
yargs-parser project, for more information about these various parsing settings.

    .number(‘foo’)

    The new number type has been added to yargs, this works similar to string and
boolean.

    

    Commands 2.0

    Commands always felt a bit clunky in yargs 3.x, I found myself creating a
lot of boiler plate code.

    yargs 4.x includes several updates to help solve this problem:

    Named Positional Arguments

    When creating a command you can now specify optional and required
positional arguments:

      
  yargs.command('get <source> [proxy]', 'make a get HTTP request')
    .help()
    .argv
  


    The above code creates a get command, with the required source
argument, and the optional proxy argument.

    These positional arguments will be populated in argv, like so:

      
  {
    "_": ["get"]
    "source": "the-source-you-entered",
    "proxy": "the-proxy-address-you-entered"
  }
  


    Builders and Handlers

    For building a complex command-line interface, yargs now allows you to
specify a builder, and a handler:

    builders allow you to specify what arguments a sub-command
should accept.

    handlers are invoked with the parsed argv object, if a command is
triggered.

    This design makes it easy to pull your commands into their own modules:

    my-module.js:

      
  // my-module.js
  exports.builder = {
    banana: {
      default: 'cool'
    },
    batman: {
      default: 'sad'
    }
  }

  exports.handler = function (argv) {
    // do something with argv.
  }
  


    my-bin.js:

      
  yargs.command('get <source> [proxy]', 'make a get HTTP request', require('my-module'))
    .help(
    .argv
  


    Global Options

    Globals make defining the options that commands accept less repetitive.
Global options will not be reset when
invoking a sub-command. Commands like help() and version() default to being
global. What does this mean?

    If I write:

      
  yargs.command('get <source> [proxy]', 'make a get HTTP request', require('my-module'))
    .help()
    .argv
  


    Calling:

    my-bin get --help

    will return help specific to the get command, without me needing to redeclare this fact.

    When called with no arguments in 3.x, help would return a string representation of
the usage string that yargs would output. This felt inconsistent with
other API methods (.env(), .completion()), which simply use a default
option name when called with no arguments.

    Calling .help() with no arguments will now default to enabling help
when --help is passed to your CLI application.

    .command()

    There has been a major overhaul to the command API (which I will be discussing
  in its own section).

    .version()

    .version() took its arguments in
the opposite order to other API methods: version #, followed by key.

    .version() now takes arguments in an API consistent order: key, followed by version #. Calling version with no arguments will now default to using the --version key,
and outputting the version # read from your package.json.

    .strict()

    strict mode will now require that any commands executed have been
registered using .command().

    But Wait, There’s More! Exciting New Features

    .pkgConf(key, cwd)

    The new .pkgConf() feature allows you to specify that yargs should load
default configuration values from a key in your package.json, e.g.,:

      
  require('yargs')
    .pkgConf('nyc')
  


    Would load the default reporter value from:

      
  {
    "name": "nyc",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "nyc": {
      "reporter": "lcov"
    }
  }
  


    Configure The Yargs Parser

    You can now turn on and off various features in the yargs parser:

    
      short-option-groups
      camel-case-expansion
      dot-notation
      parse-numbers
      boolean-negation
    

    To do so create a yargs stanza in your project’s package.json:

      
  {
    "name": "nyc",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "yargs": {
      "short-option-groups": false,
      "boolean-negation": false
    }
  }
  


    See the Configuration Documentation of the
yargs-parser project, for more information about these various parsing settings.

    .number(‘foo’)

    The new number type has been added to yargs, this works similar to string and
boolean.

    

    Commands 2.0

    Commands always felt a bit clunky in yargs 3.x, I found myself creating a
lot of boiler plate code.

    yargs 4.x includes several updates to help solve this problem:

    Named Positional Arguments

    When creating a command you can now specify optional and required
positional arguments:

      
  yargs.command('get <source> [proxy]', 'make a get HTTP request')
    .help()
    .argv
  


    The above code creates a get command, with the required source
argument, and the optional proxy argument.

    These positional arguments will be populated in argv, like so:

      
  {
    "_": ["get"]
    "source": "the-source-you-entered",
    "proxy": "the-proxy-address-you-entered"
  }
  


    Builders and Handlers

    For building a complex command-line interface, yargs now allows you to
specify a builder, and a handler:

    builders allow you to specify what arguments a sub-command
should accept.

    handlers are invoked with the parsed argv object, if a command is
triggered.

    This design makes it easy to pull your commands into their own modules:

    my-module.js:

      
  // my-module.js
  exports.builder = {
    banana: {
      default: 'cool'
    },
    batman: {
      default: 'sad'
    }
  }

  exports.handler = function (argv) {
    // do something with argv.
  }
  


    my-bin.js:

      
  yargs.command('get <source> [proxy]', 'make a get HTTP request', require('my-module'))
    .help(
    .argv
  


    Global Options

    Globals make defining the options that commands accept less repetitive.
Global options will not be reset when
invoking a sub-command. Commands like help() and version() default to being
global. What does this mean?

    If I write:

      
  yargs.command('get <source> [proxy]', 'make a get HTTP request', require('my-module'))
    .help()
    .argv
  


    Calling:

    my-bin get --help

    will return help specific to the get command, without me needing to redeclare this fact.

    Yargs is More Modular

    As part of the move to yargs 4.x, yargs has been split into more modules:

    
      yargs — yargs core.
      yargs-parser — the part of yargs that actually parses argv.
      y18n — yargs’ i18n library.
      cliui — yargs’ CLI layout library.
    

    Yargs is Moving Into An Organization

    One final big announcement, yargs’ is being moved into an organization. What does this mean?

    There’s a Website

    There is now a beautiful new website which Irina Shestak has
been leading development on:

    http://yargs.js.org/

    There Are More Contributors

    The yargs’ libraries are being moved into a GitHub organization, and several core contributors have been added:

    
      Ben Coe
      Andrew Goode
      Irina Shestak
      Max Rittmüller

    I’m excited to announce that yargs 4.0 is here and it’s a big update!

    I had a few major goals for this update:

other API methods (.env(), .completion()), which simply use a default
option name when called with no arguments.\nCalling .help() with no arguments will now default to enabling help
when --help is passed to your CLI application.\nThere has been a major overhaul to the command API (which I will be discussing
  in its own section).\n.version() took its arguments in
the opposite order to other API methods: version #, followed by key.\n.version() now takes arguments in an API consistent order: key, followed by version #. Calling version with no arguments will now default to using the --version key,
and outputting the version # read from your package.json.\nstrict mode will now require that any commands executed have been
registered using .command().\nBut Wait, There’s More! Exciting New Features\nThe new .pkgConf() feature allows you to specify that yargs should load
default configuration values from a key in your package.json, e.g.,:\nWould load the default reporter value from:\nConfigure The Yargs Parser\nYou can now turn on and off various features in the yargs parser:\nTo do so create a yargs stanza in your project’s package.json:\nSee the Configuration Documentation of the
yargs-parser project, for more information about these various parsing settings.\nConfiguration Documentation\nThe new number type has been added to yargs, this works similar to string and
boolean.\nCommands always felt a bit clunky in yargs 3.x, I found myself creating a
lot of boiler plate code.\nyargs 4.x includes several updates to help solve this problem:\nNamed Positional Arguments\nWhen creating a command you can now specify optional and required
positional arguments:\nThe above code creates a get command, with the required source
argument, and the optional proxy argument.\nThese positional arguments will be populated in argv, like so:\nBuilders and Handlers\nFor building a complex command-line interface, yargs now allows you to
specify a builder, and a handler:\nbuilders allow you to specify what arguments a sub-command
should accept.\nhandlers are invoked with the parsed argv object, if a command is
triggered.\nThis design makes it easy to pull your commands into their own modules:\nGlobals make defining the options that commands accept less repetitive.
Global options will not be reset when
invoking a sub-command. Commands like help() and version() default to being
global. What does this mean?\nwill return help specific to the get command, without me needing to redeclare this fact.\nYargs is More Modular\nAs part of the move to yargs 4.x, yargs has been split into more modules:\nyargs-parser — the part of yargs that actually parses argv.\ny18n — yargs’ i18n library.\ncliui — yargs’ CLI layout library.\nYargs is Moving Into An Organization\nOne final big announcement, yargs’ is being moved into an organization. What does this mean?\nThere is now a beautiful new website which Irina Shestak has
been leading development on:\nThere Are More Contributors\nThe yargs’ libraries are being moved into a GitHub organization, and several core contributors have been added:\nA special thanks to James Womack and Chris Dickinson, who helped create a beautiful logo for the organization.\nRead The Contributor Guidelines\nIn an effort to ensure that yargs is a project that is inviting to
new developers, and creates a safe environment for folks to work in, a
contributor’s code of conduct has been added:\nhttp://yargs.js.org/contributing/\nhttp://yargs.js.org/contributing/\nThank you to everyone who has made the yargs project possible, I couldn’t
be more excited about the future \o/\nWe got stickers!
