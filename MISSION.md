# Mission Statement

_"Be a go-to plot library with a CLI, be the jq of formulae visualisations."_

repository0-plot-code-lib is a versatile CLI tool for plotting and analyzing mathematical functions.
Our mission is to "Be a go-to plot library with a CLI, be the jq of formulae visualisations." This tool supports a broad
range of plotting functionalitiesâ€”from basic functions like sine, cosine, exponential, and logarithmic plots to advanced
visualizations including enhanced spiral, polar heatmap, dual axis, box plot, violin plot, damped oscillation, harmonics,
modulated sine, statistical summary, parametric plot, cumulative average, inverse function plotting, enhanced parametric
plots, random walk and phyllotaxis plots, and more. Recent updates include extended 3D plotting, enhanced exponential
decay plotting functions, a new modulo plotting function, a scatter plot function, and significant improvements in test
coverage with enhanced external resource mocks.
