node-canvas


node-canvas is a Cairo-backed Canvas implementation for Node.js.
Installation
$ npm install canvas
By default, pre-built binaries will be downloaded if you're on one of the following platforms:

macOS x86/64
macOS aarch64 (aka Apple silicon)
Linux x86/64 (glibc only)
Windows x86/64

If you want to build from source, use npm install --build-from-source and see the Compiling section below.
The minimum version of Node.js required is 18.12.0.
Compiling
If you don't have a supported OS or processor architecture, or you use --build-from-source, the module will be compiled on your system. This requires several dependencies, including Cairo and Pango.
For detailed installation information, see the wiki. One-line installation instructions for common OSes are below. Note that libgif/giflib, librsvg and libjpeg are optional and only required if you need GIF, SVG and JPEG support, respectively. Cairo v1.10.0 or later is required.

const canvas = createCanvas(200, 200)
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d')

// Write "Awesome!"
ctx.font = '30px Impact'
ctx.rotate(0.1)
ctx.fillText('Awesome!', 50, 100)

// Draw line under text
var text = ctx.measureText('Awesome!')
ctx.strokeStyle = 'rgba(0,0,0,0.5)'
ctx.beginPath()
ctx.lineTo(50, 102)
ctx.lineTo(50 + text.width, 102)
ctx.stroke()

// Draw cat with lime helmet
loadImage('examples/images/lime-cat.jpg').then((image) => {
  ctx.drawImage(image, 50, 0, 70, 70)

  console.log('<img src="' + canvas.toDataURL() + '" />')
})

createCanvas()

createCanvas(width: number, height: number, type?: 'PDF'|'SVG') => Canvas

Creates a Canvas instance. This method works in both Node.js and Web browsers, where there is no Canvas constructor. (See browser.js for the implementation that runs in browsers.)
const { createCanvas } = require('canvas')
const mycanvas = createCanvas(200, 200)
const myPDFcanvas = createCanvas(600, 800, 'pdf') // see "PDF Support" section
createImageData()

createImageData(width: number, height: number) => ImageData
createImageData(data: Uint8ClampedArray, width: number, height?: number) => ImageData
// for alternative pixel formats:
createImageData(data: Uint16Array, width: number, height?: number) => ImageData

Creates an ImageData instance. This method works in both Node.js and Web browsers.
const { createImageData } = require('canvas')
const width = 20, height = 20
const arraySize = width * height * 4
const mydata = createImageData(new Uint8ClampedArray(arraySize), width)
loadImage()

loadImage() => Promise<Image>

Convenience method for loading images. This method works in both Node.js and Web browsers.
const { loadImage } = require('canvas')
const myimg = loadImage('http://server.com/image.png')

myimg.then(() => {
  // do something with image
}).catch(err => {
  console.log('oh no!', err)
})

// or with async/await:
const myimg = await loadImage('http://server.com/image.png')
// do something with image
registerFont()

registerFont(path: string, { family: string, weight?: string, style?: string }) => void

To use a font file that is not installed as a system font, use registerFont() to register the font with Canvas.
const { registerFont, createCanvas } = require('canvas')
registerFont('comicsans.ttf', { family: 'Comic Sans' })

const canvas = createCanvas(500, 500)
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d')

ctx.font = '12px "Comic Sans"'
ctx.fillText('Everyone hates this font :(', 250, 10)
The second argument is an object with properties that resemble the CSS properties that are specified in @font-face rules. You must specify at least family. weight, and style are optional and default to 'normal'.
deregisterAllFonts()

deregisterAllFonts() => void

Use deregisterAllFonts to unregister all fonts that have been previously registered. This method is useful when you want to remove all registered fonts, such as when using the canvas in tests
const { registerFont, createCanvas, deregisterAllFonts } = require('canvas')

describe('text rendering', () => {
    afterEach(() => {
        deregisterAllFonts();
    })
    it('should render text with Comic Sans', () => {
        registerFont('comicsans.ttf', { family: 'Comic Sans' })

        const canvas = createCanvas(500, 500)
        const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d')
        
        ctx.font = '12px "Comic Sans"'
        ctx.fillText('Everyone loves this font :)', 250, 10)
        
        // assertScreenshot()
    })
})
Image#src

img.src: string|Buffer

As in browsers, img.src can be set to a data: URI or a remote URL. In addition, node-canvas allows setting src to a local file path or Buffer instance.
const { Image } = require('canvas')

// From a buffer:
fs.readFile('images/squid.png', (err, squid) => {
  if (err) throw err
  const img = new Image()
  img.onload = () => ctx.drawImage(img, 0, 0)
  img.onerror = err => { throw err }
  img.src = squid
})

// From a local file path:
const img = new Image()
img.onload = () => ctx.drawImage(img, 0, 0)
img.onerror = err => { throw err }
img.src = 'images/squid.png'

// From a remote URL:
img.src = 'http://picsum.photos/200/300'
// ... as above

// From a `data:` URI:
img.src = 'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAUAAAAFCAYAAACNbyblAAAAHElEQVQI12P4//8/w38GIAXDIBKE0DHxgljNBAAO9TXL0Y4OHwAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=='
// ... as above
Note: In some cases, img.src= is currently synchronous. However, you should always use img.onload and img.onerror, as we intend to make img.src= always asynchronous as it is in browsers. See #1007.
Image#dataMode

img.dataMode: number

Applies to JPEG images drawn to PDF canvases only.
Setting img.dataMode = Image.MODE_MIME or Image.MODE_MIME|Image.MODE_IMAGE enables MIME data tracking of images. When MIME data is tracked, PDF canvases can embed JPEGs directly into the output, rather than re-encoding into PNG. This can drastically reduce filesize and speed up rendering.
const { Image, createCanvas } = require('canvas')
const canvas = createCanvas(w, h, 'pdf')
const img = new Image()
img.dataMode = Image.MODE_IMAGE // Only image data tracked
img.dataMode = Image.MODE_MIME // Only mime data tracked
img.dataMode = Image.MODE_MIME | Image.MODE_IMAGE // Both are tracked
If working with a non-PDF canvas, image data must be tracked; otherwise the output will be junk.
Enabling mime data tracking has no benefits (only a slow down) unless you are generating a PDF.
Canvas#toBuffer()

canvas.toBuffer((err: Error|null, result: Buffer) => void, mimeType?: string, config?: any) => void
canvas.toBuffer(mimeType?: string, config?: any) => Buffer

Creates a Buffer object representing the image contained in the canvas.

callback If provided, the buffer will be provided in the callback instead of being returned by the function. Invoked with an error as the first argument if encoding failed, or the resulting buffer as the second argument if it succeeded. Not supported for mimeType raw or for PDF or SVG canvases.
mimeType A string indicating the image format. Valid options are image/png, image/jpeg (if node-canvas was built with JPEG support), raw (unencoded data in BGRA order on little-endian (most) systems, ARGB on big-endian systems; top-to-bottom), application/pdf (for PDF canvases) and image/svg+xml (for SVG canvases). Defaults to image/png for image canvases, or the corresponding type for PDF or SVG canvas.
config


For image/jpeg, an object specifying the quality (0 to 1), if progressive compression should be used and/or if chroma subsampling should be used: {quality: 0.75, progressive: false, chromaSubsampling: true}. All properties are optional.


For image/png, an object specifying the ZLIB compression level (between 0 and 9), the compression filter(s), the palette (indexed PNGs only), the the background palette index (indexed PNGs only) and/or the resolution (ppi): {compressionLevel: 6, filters: canvas.PNG_ALL_FILTERS, palette: undefined, backgroundIndex: 0, resolution: undefined}. All properties are optional.
Note that the PNG format encodes the resolution in pixels per meter, so if you specify 96, the file will encode 3780 ppm (~96.01 ppi). The resolution is undefined by default to match common browser behavior.


For application/pdf, an object specifying optional document metadata: {title: string, author: string, subject: string, keywords: string, creator: string, creationDate: Date, modDate: Date}. All properties are optional and default to undefined, except for creationDate, which defaults to the current date. Adding metadata requires Cairo 1.16.0 or later.
For a description of these properties, see page 550 of PDF 32000-1:2008.
Note that there is no standard separator for keywords. A space is recommended because it is in common use by other applications, and Cairo will enclose the list of keywords in quotes if a comma or semicolon is used.




Return value
If no callback is provided, a Buffer. If a callback is provided, none.
Examples
// Default: buf contains a PNG-encoded image
const buf = canvas.toBuffer()

// PNG-encoded, zlib compression level 3 for faster compression but bigger files, no filtering
const buf2 = canvas.toBuffer('image/png', { compressionLevel: 3, filters: canvas.PNG_FILTER_NONE })

// JPEG-encoded, 50% quality
const buf3 = canvas.toBuffer('image/jpeg', { quality: 0.5 })

// Asynchronous PNG
canvas.toBuffer((err, buf) => {
  if (err) throw err // encoding failed
  // buf is PNG-encoded image
})

canvas.toBuffer((err, buf) => {
  if (err) throw err // encoding failed
  // buf is JPEG-encoded image at 95% quality
}, 'image/jpeg', { quality: 0.95 })

// BGRA pixel values, native-endian
const buf4 = canvas.toBuffer('raw')
const { stride, width } = canvas
// In memory, this is `canvas.height * canvas.stride` bytes long.
// The top row of pixels, in BGRA order on little-endian hardware,
// left-to-right, is:
const topPixelsBGRALeftToRight = buf4.slice(0, width * 4)
// And the third row is:
const row3 = buf4.slice(2 * stride, 2 * stride + width * 4)

// SVG and PDF canvases
const myCanvas = createCanvas(w, h, 'pdf')
myCanvas.toBuffer() // returns a buffer containing a PDF-encoded canvas
// With optional metadata:
myCanvas.toBuffer('application/pdf', {
  title: 'my picture',
  keywords: 'node.js demo cairo',
  creationDate: new Date()
})
Canvas#createPNGStream()

canvas.createPNGStream(config?: any) => ReadableStream

Creates a ReadableStream that emits PNG-encoded data.

config An object specifying the ZLIB compression level (between 0 and 9), the compression filter(s), the palette (indexed PNGs only) and/or the background palette index (indexed PNGs only): {compressionLevel: 6, filters: canvas.PNG_ALL_FILTERS, palette: undefined, backgroundIndex: 0, resolution: undefined}. All properties are optional.

Examples
const fs = require('fs')
const out = fs.createWriteStream(__dirname + '/test.png')
const stream = canvas.createPNGStream()
stream.pipe(out)
out.on('finish', () =>  console.log('The PNG file was created.'))
To encode indexed PNGs from canvases with pixelFormat: 'A8' or 'A1', provide an options object:
const palette = new Uint8ClampedArray([
  //r    g    b    a
    0,  50,  50, 255, // index 1
   10,  90,  90, 255, // index 2
  127, 127, 255, 255
  // ...
])
canvas.createPNGStream({
  palette: palette,
  backgroundIndex: 0 // optional, defaults to 0
})
Canvas#createJPEGStream()

canvas.createJPEGStream(config?: any) => ReadableStream

Creates a ReadableStream that emits JPEG-encoded data.
Note: At the moment, createJPEGStream() is synchronous under the hood. That is, it runs in the main thread, not in the libuv threadpool.

config an object specifying the quality (0 to 1), if progressive compression should be used and/or if chroma subsampling should be used: {quality: 0.75, progressive: false, chromaSubsampling: true}. All properties are optional.

Examples
const fs = require('fs')
const out = fs.createWriteStream(__dirname + '/test.jpeg')
const stream = canvas.createJPEGStream()
stream.pipe(out)
out.on('finish', () =>  console.log('The JPEG file was created.'))

// Disable 2x2 chromaSubsampling for deeper colors and use a higher quality
const stream = canvas.createJPEGStream({
  quality: 0.95,
  chromaSubsampling: false
})
Canvas#createPDFStream()

canvas.createPDFStream(config?: any) => ReadableStream


config an object specifying optional document metadata: {title: string, author: string, subject: string, keywords: string, creator: string, creationDate: Date, modDate: Date}. See toBuffer() for more information. Adding metadata requires Cairo 1.16.0 or later.

Applies to PDF canvases only. Creates a ReadableStream that emits the encoded PDF. canvas.toBuffer() also produces an encoded PDF, but createPDFStream() can be used to reduce memory usage.
Canvas#toDataURL()
This is a standard API, but several non-standard calls are supported. The full list of supported calls is:
dataUrl = canvas.toDataURL() // defaults to PNG
dataUrl = canvas.toDataURL('image/png')
dataUrl = canvas.toDataURL('image/jpeg')
dataUrl = canvas.toDataURL('image/jpeg', quality) // quality from 0 to 1
canvas.toDataURL((err, png) => { }) // defaults to PNG
canvas.toDataURL('image/png', (err, png) => { })
canvas.toDataURL('image/jpeg', (err, jpeg) => { }) // sync JPEG is not supported
canvas.toDataURL('image/jpeg', {...opts}, (err, jpeg) => { }) // see Canvas#createJPEGStream for valid options
canvas.toDataURL('image/jpeg', quality, (err, jpeg) => { }) // spec-following; quality from 0 to 1
CanvasRenderingContext2D#patternQuality

context.patternQuality: 'fast'|'good'|'best'|'nearest'|'bilinear'

Defaults to 'good'. Affects pattern (gradient, image, etc.) rendering quality.
CanvasRenderingContext2D#quality

context.quality: 'fast'|'good'|'best'|'nearest'|'bilinear'

Defaults to 'good'. Like patternQuality, but applies to transformations affecting more than just patterns.
CanvasRenderingContext2D#textDrawingMode

context.textDrawingMode: 'path'|'glyph'

Defaults to 'path'. The effect depends on the canvas type:


Standard (image) glyph and path both result in rasterized text. Glyph mode is faster than path, but may result in lower-quality text, especially when rotated or translated.


PDF glyph will embed text instead of paths into the PDF. This is faster to encode, faster to open with PDF viewers, yields a smaller file size and makes the text selectable. The subset of the font needed to render the glyphs will be embedded in the PDF. This is usually the mode you want to use with PDF canvases.


SVG glyph does not cause <text> elements to be produced as one might expect (cairo bug). Rather, glyph will create a <defs> section with a <symbol> for each glyph, then those glyphs be reused via <use> elements. path mode creates a <path> element for each text string. glyph mode is faster and yields a smaller file size.


In glyph mode, ctx.strokeText() and ctx.fillText() behave the same (aside from using the stroke and fill style, respectively).
This property is tracked as part of the canvas state in save/restore.
CanvasRenderingContext2D#globalCompositeOperation = 'saturate'
In addition to all of the standard global composite operations defined by the Canvas specification, the 'saturate' operation is also available.
CanvasRenderingContext2D#antialias

context.antialias: 'default'|'none'|'gray'|'subpixel'

Sets the anti-aliasing mode.
PDF Output Support
node-canvas can create PDF documents instead of images. The canvas type must be set when creating the canvas as follows:
const canvas = createCanvas(200, 500, 'pdf')
An additional method .addPage() is then available to create multiple page PDFs:
// On first page
ctx.font = '22px Helvetica'
ctx.fillText('Hello World', 50, 80)

ctx.addPage()
// Now on second page
ctx.font = '22px Helvetica'
ctx.fillText('Hello World 2', 50, 80)

canvas.toBuffer() // returns a PDF file
canvas.createPDFStream() // returns a ReadableStream that emits a PDF
// With optional document metadata (requires Cairo 1.16.0):
canvas.toBuffer('application/pdf', {
  title: 'my picture',
  keywords: 'node.js demo cairo',
  creationDate: new Date()
})
It is also possible to create pages with different sizes by passing width and height to the .addPage() method:
ctx.font = '22px Helvetica'
ctx.fillText('Hello World', 50, 80)
ctx.addPage(400, 800)

ctx.fillText('Hello World 2', 50, 80)
It is possible to add hyperlinks using .beginTag() and .endTag():
ctx.beginTag('Link', "uri='https://google.com'")
ctx.font = '22px Helvetica'
ctx.fillText('Hello World', 50, 80)
ctx.endTag('Link')
Or with a defined rectangle:
ctx.beginTag('Link', "uri='https://google.com' rect=[50 80 100 20]")
ctx.endTag('Link')
Note that the syntax for attributes is unique to Cairo. See cairo_tag_begin for the full documentation.
You can create areas on the canvas using the "cairo.dest" tag, and then link to them using the "Link" tag with the dest= attribute. You can also define PDF structure for accessibility by using tag names like "P", "H1", and "TABLE". The standard tags are defined in §14.8.4 of the PDF 1.7 specification.

Image#dataMode for embedding JPEGs in PDFs
Canvas#createPDFStream() for creating PDF streams
CanvasRenderingContext2D#textDrawingMode
for embedding text instead of paths

SVG Output Support
node-canvas can create SVG documents instead of images. The canvas type must be set when creating the canvas as follows:
const canvas = createCanvas(200, 500, 'svg')
// Use the normal primitives.
fs.writeFileSync('out.svg', canvas.toBuffer())
SVG Image Support
If librsvg is available when node-canvas is installed, node-canvas can render SVG images to your canvas context. This currently works by rasterizing the SVG image (i.e. drawing an SVG image to an SVG canvas will not preserve the SVG data).
const img = new Image()
img.onload = () => ctx.drawImage(img, 0, 0)
img.onerror = err => { throw err }
img.src = './example.svg'
Image pixel formats (experimental)
node-canvas has experimental support for additional pixel formats, roughly following the Canvas color space proposal.
const canvas = createCanvas(200, 200)
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d', { pixelFormat: 'A8' })
By default, canvases are created in the RGBA32 format, which corresponds to the native HTML Canvas behavior. Each pixel is 32 bits. The JavaScript APIs that involve pixel data (getImageData, putImageData) store the colors in the order {red, green, blue, alpha} without alpha pre-multiplication. (The C++ API stores the colors in the order {alpha, red, green, blue} in native-endian ordering, with alpha pre-multiplication.)
These additional pixel formats have experimental support:

RGB24 Like RGBA32, but the 8 alpha bits are always opaque. This format is always used if the alpha context attribute is set to false (i.e. canvas.getContext('2d', {alpha: false})). This format can be faster than RGBA32 because transparency does not need to be calculated.
A8 Each pixel is 8 bits. This format can either be used for creating grayscale images (treating each byte as an alpha value), or for creating indexed PNGs (treating each byte as a palette index) (see the example using alpha values with fillStyle and the example using imageData).
RGB16_565 Each pixel is 16 bits, with red in the upper 5 bits, green in the middle 6 bits, and blue in the lower 5 bits, in native platform endianness. Some hardware devices and frame buffers use this format. Note that PNG does not support this format; when creating a PNG, the image will be converted to 24-bit RGB. This format is thus suboptimal for generating PNGs. ImageData instances for this mode use a Uint16Array instead of a Uint8ClampedArray.
A1 Each pixel is 1 bit, and pixels are packed together into 32-bit quantities. The ordering of the bits matches the endianness of the
platform: on a little-endian machine, the first pixel is the least-significant bit. This format can be used for creating single-color images. Support for this format is incomplete, see note below.
RGB30 Each pixel is 30 bits, with red in the upper 10, green in the middle 10, and blue in the lower 10. (Requires Cairo 1.12 or later.) Support for this format is incomplete, see note below.

Notes and caveats:


Using a non-default format can affect the behavior of APIs that involve pixel data:

context2d.createImageData The size of the array returned depends on the number of bit per pixel for the underlying image data format, per the above descriptions.
context2d.getImageData The format of the array returned depends on the underlying image mode, per the above descriptions. Be aware of platform endianness, which can be determined using node.js's os.endianness()
function.
context2d.putImageData As above.



A1 and RGB30 do not yet support getImageData or putImageData. Have a use case and/or opinion on working with these formats? Open an issue and let us know! (See #935.)


A1, A8, RGB30 and RGB16_565 with shadow blurs may crash or not render properly.


The ImageData(width, height) and ImageData(Uint8ClampedArray, width) constructors assume 4 bytes per pixel. To create an ImageData instance with a different number of bytes per pixel, use new ImageData(new Uint8ClampedArray(size), width, height) or new ImageData(new Uint16ClampedArray(size), width, height).


Testing
First make sure you've built the latest version. Get all the deps you need (see compiling above), and run:
npm install --build-from-source

For visual tests: npm run test-server and point your browser to http://localhost:4000.
For unit tests: npm run test.
Benchmarks
Benchmarks live in the benchmarks directory.
Examples
Examples line in the examples directory. Most produce a png image of the same name, and others such as live-clock.js launch an HTTP server to be viewed in the browser.

node-canvas is a Cairo-backed Canvas implementation for Node.js.
Installation
$ npm install canvas
By default, pre-built binaries will be downloaded if you're on one of the following platforms:

macOS x86/64
macOS aarch64 (aka Apple silicon)
Linux x86/64 (glibc only)
Windows x86/64

If you want to build from source, use npm install --build-from-source and see the Compiling section below.
The minimum version of Node.js required is 18.12.0.
Compiling
If you don't have a supported OS or processor architecture, or you use --build-from-source, the module will be compiled on your system. This requires several dependencies, including Cairo and Pango.
For detailed installation information, see the wiki. One-line installation instructions for common OSes are below. Note that libgif/giflib, librsvg and libjpeg are optional and only required if you need GIF, SVG and JPEG support, respectively. Cairo v1.10.0 or later is required.



OS
Command




macOS
Using Homebrew:brew install pkg-config cairo pango libpng jpeg giflib librsvg pixman python-setuptools


Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install build-essential libcairo2-dev libpango1.0-dev libjpeg-dev libgif-dev librsvg2-dev


Fedora
sudo yum install gcc-c++ cairo-devel pango-devel libjpeg-turbo-devel giflib-devel


Solaris
pkgin install cairo pango pkg-config xproto renderproto kbproto xextproto


OpenBSD

Mac OS X v10.11+: If you have recently updated to Mac OS X v10.11+ and are experiencing trouble when compiling, run the following command: xcode-select --install. Read more about the problem on Stack Overflow.
If you have xcode 10.0 or higher installed, in order to build from source you need NPM 6.4.1 or higher.
Quick Example
const { createCanvas, loadImage } = require('canvas')
const canvas = createCanvas(200, 200)
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d')

// Write "Awesome!"
ctx.font = '30px Impact'
ctx.rotate(0.1)
ctx.fillText('Awesome!', 50, 100)

// Draw line under text
var text = ctx.measureText('Awesome!')
ctx.strokeStyle = 'rgba(0,0,0,0.5)'
ctx.beginPath()
ctx.lineTo(50, 102)
ctx.lineTo(50 + text.width, 102)
ctx.stroke()

// Draw cat with lime helmet
loadImage('examples/images/lime-cat.jpg').then((image) => {
  ctx.drawImage(image, 50, 0, 70, 70)

  console.log('<img src="' + canvas.toDataURL() + '" />')
})

createCanvas()

createCanvas(width: number, height: number, type?: 'PDF'|'SVG') => Canvas

Creates a Canvas instance. This method works in both Node.js and Web browsers, where there is no Canvas constructor. (See browser.js for the implementation that runs in browsers.)
const { createCanvas } = require('canvas')
const mycanvas = createCanvas(200, 200)
const myPDFcanvas = createCanvas(600, 800, 'pdf') // see "PDF Support" section
createImageData()

createImageData(width: number, height: number) => ImageData
createImageData(data: Uint8ClampedArray, width: number, height?: number) => ImageData
// for alternative pixel formats:
createImageData(data: Uint16Array, width: number, height?: number) => ImageData

Creates an ImageData instance. This method works in both Node.js and Web browsers.
const { createImageData } = require('canvas')
const width = 20, height = 20
const arraySize = width * height * 4
const mydata = createImageData(new Uint8ClampedArray(arraySize), width)
loadImage()

loadImage() => Promise<Image>

Convenience method for loading images. This method works in both Node.js and Web browsers.
const { loadImage } = require('canvas')
const myimg = loadImage('http://server.com/image.png')

myimg.then(() => {
  // do something with image
}).catch(err => {
  console.log('oh no!', err)
})

// or with async/await:
const myimg = await loadImage('http://server.com/image.png')
// do something with image
registerFont()

registerFont(path: string, { family: string, weight?: string, style?: string }) => void

To use a font file that is not installed as a system font, use registerFont() to register the font with Canvas.
const { registerFont, createCanvas } = require('canvas')
registerFont('comicsans.ttf', { family: 'Comic Sans' })

const canvas = createCanvas(500, 500)
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d')

ctx.font = '12px "Comic Sans"'
ctx.fillText('Everyone hates this font :(', 250, 10)
The second argument is an object with properties that resemble the CSS properties that are specified in @font-face rules. You must specify at least family. weight, and style are optional and default to 'normal'.
deregisterAllFonts()

deregisterAllFonts() => void

Use deregisterAllFonts to unregister all fonts that have been previously registered. This method is useful when you want to remove all registered fonts, such as when using the canvas in tests
const { registerFont, createCanvas, deregisterAllFonts } = require('canvas')

describe('text rendering', () => {
    afterEach(() => {
        deregisterAllFonts();
    })
    it('should render text with Comic Sans', () => {
        registerFont('comicsans.ttf', { family: 'Comic Sans' })

        const canvas = createCanvas(500, 500)
        const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d')
        
        ctx.font = '12px "Comic Sans"'
        ctx.fillText('Everyone loves this font :)', 250, 10)
        
        // assertScreenshot()
    })
})
Image#src

img.src: string|Buffer

As in browsers, img.src can be set to a data: URI or a remote URL. In addition, node-canvas allows setting src to a local file path or Buffer instance.
const { Image } = require('canvas')

// From a buffer:
fs.readFile('images/squid.png', (err, squid) => {
  if (err) throw err
  const img = new Image()
  img.onload = () => ctx.drawImage(img, 0, 0)
  img.onerror = err => { throw err }
  img.src = squid
})

// From a local file path:
const img = new Image()
img.onload = () => ctx.drawImage(img, 0, 0)
img.onerror = err => { throw err }
img.src = 'images/squid.png'

// From a remote URL:
img.src = 'http://picsum.photos/200/300'
// ... as above

// From a `data:` URI:
img.src = 'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAUAAAAFCAYAAACNbyblAAAAHElEQVQI12P4//8/w38GIAXDIBKE0DHxgljNBAAO9TXL0Y4OHwAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=='
// ... as above
Note: In some cases, img.src= is currently synchronous. However, you should always use img.onload and img.onerror, as we intend to make img.src= always asynchronous as it is in browsers. See #1007.
Image#dataMode

img.dataMode: number

Applies to JPEG images drawn to PDF canvases only.
Setting img.dataMode = Image.MODE_MIME or Image.MODE_MIME|Image.MODE_IMAGE enables MIME data tracking of images. When MIME data is tracked, PDF canvases can embed JPEGs directly into the output, rather than re-encoding into PNG. This can drastically reduce filesize and speed up rendering.
const { Image, createCanvas } = require('canvas')
const canvas = createCanvas(w, h, 'pdf')
const img = new Image()
img.dataMode = Image.MODE_IMAGE // Only image data tracked
img.dataMode = Image.MODE_MIME // Only mime data tracked
img.dataMode = Image.MODE_MIME | Image.MODE_IMAGE // Both are tracked
If working with a non-PDF canvas, image data must be tracked; otherwise the output will be junk.
Enabling mime data tracking has no benefits (only a slow down) unless you are generating a PDF.
Canvas#toBuffer()

canvas.toBuffer((err: Error|null, result: Buffer) => void, mimeType?: string, config?: any) => void
canvas.toBuffer(mimeType?: string, config?: any) => Buffer

Creates a Buffer object representing the image contained in the canvas.

callback If provided, the buffer will be provided in the callback instead of being returned by the function. Invoked with an error as the first argument if encoding failed, or the resulting buffer as the second argument if it succeeded. Not supported for mimeType raw or for PDF or SVG canvases.
mimeType A string indicating the image format. Valid options are image/png, image/jpeg (if node-canvas was built with JPEG support), raw (unencoded data in BGRA order on little-endian (most) systems, ARGB on big-endian systems; top-to-bottom), application/pdf (for PDF canvases) and image/svg+xml (for SVG canvases). Defaults to image/png for image canvases, or the corresponding type for PDF or SVG canvas.
config


For image/jpeg, an object specifying the quality (0 to 1), if progressive compression should be used and/or if chroma subsampling should be used: {quality: 0.75, progressive: false, chromaSubsampling: true}. All properties are optional.


For image/png, an object specifying the ZLIB compression level (between 0 and 9), the compression filter(s), the palette (indexed PNGs only), the the background palette index (indexed PNGs only) and/or the resolution (ppi): {compressionLevel: 6, filters: canvas.PNG_ALL_FILTERS, palette: undefined, backgroundIndex: 0, resolution: undefined}. All properties are optional.
Note that the PNG format encodes the resolution in pixels per meter, so if you specify 96, the file will encode 3780 ppm (~96.01 ppi). The resolution is undefined by default to match common browser behavior.


For application/pdf, an object specifying optional document metadata: {title: string, author: string, subject: string, keywords: string, creator: string, creationDate: Date, modDate: Date}. All properties are optional and default to undefined, except for creationDate, which defaults to the current date. Adding metadata requires Cairo 1.16.0 or later.
For a description of these properties, see page 550 of PDF 32000-1:2008.
Note that there is no standard separator for keywords. A space is recommended because it is in common use by other applications, and Cairo will enclose the list of keywords in quotes if a comma or semicolon is used.




Return value
If no callback is provided, a Buffer. If a callback is provided, none.
Examples
// Default: buf contains a PNG-encoded image
const buf = canvas.toBuffer()

// PNG-encoded, zlib compression level 3 for faster compression but bigger files, no filtering
const buf2 = canvas.toBuffer('image/png', { compressionLevel: 3, filters: canvas.PNG_FILTER_NONE })

// JPEG-encoded, 50% quality
const buf3 = canvas.toBuffer('image/jpeg', { quality: 0.5 })

// Asynchronous PNG
canvas.toBuffer((err, buf) => {
  if (err) throw err // encoding failed
  // buf is PNG-encoded image
})

canvas.toBuffer((err, buf) => {
  if (err) throw err // encoding failed
  // buf is JPEG-encoded image at 95% quality
}, 'image/jpeg', { quality: 0.95 })

// BGRA pixel values, native-endian
const buf4 = canvas.toBuffer('raw')
const { stride, width } = canvas
// In memory, this is `canvas.height * canvas.stride` bytes long.
// The top row of pixels, in BGRA order on little-endian hardware,
// left-to-right, is:
const topPixelsBGRALeftToRight = buf4.slice(0, width * 4)
// And the third row is:
const row3 = buf4.slice(2 * stride, 2 * stride + width * 4)

// SVG and PDF canvases
const myCanvas = createCanvas(w, h, 'pdf')
myCanvas.toBuffer() // returns a buffer containing a PDF-encoded canvas
// With optional metadata:
myCanvas.toBuffer('application/pdf', {
  title: 'my picture',
  keywords: 'node.js demo cairo',
  creationDate: new Date()
})
Canvas#createPNGStream()

canvas.createPNGStream(config?: any) => ReadableStream

Creates a ReadableStream that emits PNG-encoded data.

config An object specifying the ZLIB compression level (between 0 and 9), the compression filter(s), the palette (indexed PNGs only) and/or the background palette index (indexed PNGs only): {compressionLevel: 6, filters: canvas.PNG_ALL_FILTERS, palette: undefined, backgroundIndex: 0, resolution: undefined}. All properties are optional.

Examples
const fs = require('fs')
const out = fs.createWriteStream(__dirname + '/test.png')
const stream = canvas.createPNGStream()
stream.pipe(out)
out.on('finish', () =>  console.log('The PNG file was created.'))
To encode indexed PNGs from canvases with pixelFormat: 'A8' or 'A1', provide an options object:
const palette = new Uint8ClampedArray([
  //r    g    b    a
    0,  50,  50, 255, // index 1
   10,  90,  90, 255, // index 2
  127, 127, 255, 255
  // ...
])
canvas.createPNGStream({
  palette: palette,
  backgroundIndex: 0 // optional, defaults to 0
})
Canvas#createJPEGStream()

canvas.createJPEGStream(config?: any) => ReadableStream

Creates a ReadableStream that emits JPEG-encoded data.
Note: At the moment, createJPEGStream() is synchronous under the hood. That is, it runs in the main thread, not in the libuv threadpool.

config an object specifying the quality (0 to 1), if progressive compression should be used and/or if chroma subsampling should be used: {quality: 0.75, progressive: false, chromaSubsampling: true}. All properties are optional.

Examples
const fs = require('fs')
const out = fs.createWriteStream(__dirname + '/test.jpeg')
const stream = canvas.createJPEGStream()
stream.pipe(out)
out.on('finish', () =>  console.log('The JPEG file was created.'))

// Disable 2x2 chromaSubsampling for deeper colors and use a higher quality
const stream = canvas.createJPEGStream({
  quality: 0.95,
  chromaSubsampling: false
})
Canvas#createPDFStream()

canvas.createPDFStream(config?: any) => ReadableStream


config an object specifying optional document metadata: {title: string, author: string, subject: string, keywords: string, creator: string, creationDate: Date, modDate: Date}. See toBuffer() for more information. Adding metadata requires Cairo 1.16.0 or later.

Applies to PDF canvases only. Creates a ReadableStream that emits the encoded PDF. canvas.toBuffer() also produces an encoded PDF, but createPDFStream() can be used to reduce memory usage.
Canvas#toDataURL()
This is a standard API, but several non-standard calls are supported. The full list of supported calls is:
dataUrl = canvas.toDataURL() // defaults to PNG
dataUrl = canvas.toDataURL('image/png')
dataUrl = canvas.toDataURL('image/jpeg')
dataUrl = canvas.toDataURL('image/jpeg', quality) // quality from 0 to 1
canvas.toDataURL((err, png) => { }) // defaults to PNG
canvas.toDataURL('image/png', (err, png) => { })
canvas.toDataURL('image/jpeg', (err, jpeg) => { }) // sync JPEG is not supported
canvas.toDataURL('image/jpeg', {...opts}, (err, jpeg) => { }) // see Canvas#createJPEGStream for valid options
canvas.toDataURL('image/jpeg', quality, (err, jpeg) => { }) // spec-following; quality from 0 to 1
CanvasRenderingContext2D#patternQuality

context.patternQuality: 'fast'|'good'|'best'|'nearest'|'bilinear'

Defaults to 'good'. Affects pattern (gradient, image, etc.) rendering quality.
CanvasRenderingContext2D#quality

context.quality: 'fast'|'good'|'best'|'nearest'|'bilinear'

Defaults to 'good'. Like patternQuality, but applies to transformations affecting more than just patterns.
CanvasRenderingContext2D#textDrawingMode

context.textDrawingMode: 'path'|'glyph'

Defaults to 'path'. The effect depends on the canvas type:


Standard (image) glyph and path both result in rasterized text. Glyph mode is faster than path, but may result in lower-quality text, especially when rotated or translated.


PDF glyph will embed text instead of paths into the PDF. This is faster to encode, faster to open with PDF viewers, yields a smaller file size and makes the text selectable. The subset of the font needed to render the glyphs will be embedded in the PDF. This is usually the mode you want to use with PDF canvases.


SVG glyph does not cause <text> elements to be produced as one might expect (cairo bug). Rather, glyph will create a <defs> section with a <symbol> for each glyph, then those glyphs be reused via <use> elements. path mode creates a <path> element for each text string. glyph mode is faster and yields a smaller file size.


In glyph mode, ctx.strokeText() and ctx.fillText() behave the same (aside from using the stroke and fill style, respectively).
This property is tracked as part of the canvas state in save/restore.
CanvasRenderingContext2D#globalCompositeOperation = 'saturate'
In addition to all of the standard global composite operations defined by the Canvas specification, the 'saturate' operation is also available.
CanvasRenderingContext2D#antialias

context.antialias: 'default'|'none'|'gray'|'subpixel'

Sets the anti-aliasing mode.
PDF Output Support
node-canvas can create PDF documents instead of images. The canvas type must be set when creating the canvas as follows:
const canvas = createCanvas(200, 500, 'pdf')
An additional method .addPage() is then available to create multiple page PDFs:
// On first page
ctx.font = '22px Helvetica'
ctx.fillText('Hello World', 50, 80)

ctx.addPage()
// Now on second page
ctx.font = '22px Helvetica'
ctx.fillText('Hello World 2', 50, 80)

canvas.toBuffer() // returns a PDF file
canvas.createPDFStream() // returns a ReadableStream that emits a PDF
// With optional document metadata (requires Cairo 1.16.0):
canvas.toBuffer('application/pdf', {
  title: 'my picture',
  keywords: 'node.js demo cairo',
  creationDate: new Date()
})
It is also possible to create pages with different sizes by passing width and height to the .addPage() method:
ctx.font = '22px Helvetica'
ctx.fillText('Hello World', 50, 80)
ctx.addPage(400, 800)

ctx.fillText('Hello World 2', 50, 80)
It is possible to add hyperlinks using .beginTag() and .endTag():
ctx.beginTag('Link', "uri='https://google.com'")
ctx.font = '22px Helvetica'
ctx.fillText('Hello World', 50, 80)
ctx.endTag('Link')
Or with a defined rectangle:
ctx.beginTag('Link', "uri='https://google.com' rect=[50 80 100 20]")
ctx.endTag('Link')
Note that the syntax for attributes is unique to Cairo. See cairo_tag_begin for the full documentation.
You can create areas on the canvas using the "cairo.dest" tag, and then link to them using the "Link" tag with the dest= attribute. You can also define PDF structure for accessibility by using tag names like "P", "H1", and "TABLE". The standard tags are defined in §14.8.4 of the PDF 1.7 specification.

Image#dataMode for embedding JPEGs in PDFs
Canvas#createPDFStream() for creating PDF streams
CanvasRenderingContext2D#textDrawingMode
for embedding text instead of paths

SVG Output Support
node-canvas can create SVG documents instead of images. The canvas type must be set when creating the canvas as follows:
const canvas = createCanvas(200, 500, 'svg')
// Use the normal primitives.
fs.writeFileSync('out.svg', canvas.toBuffer())
SVG Image Support
If librsvg is available when node-canvas is installed, node-canvas can render SVG images to your canvas context. This currently works by rasterizing the SVG image (i.e. drawing an SVG image to an SVG canvas will not preserve the SVG data).
const img = new Image()
img.onload = () => ctx.drawImage(img, 0, 0)
img.onerror = err => { throw err }
img.src = './example.svg'
Image pixel formats (experimental)
node-canvas has experimental support for additional pixel formats, roughly following the Canvas color space proposal.
const canvas = createCanvas(200, 200)
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d', { pixelFormat: 'A8' })
By default, canvases are created in the RGBA32 format, which corresponds to the native HTML Canvas behavior. Each pixel is 32 bits. The JavaScript APIs that involve pixel data (getImageData, putImageData) store the colors in the order {red, green, blue, alpha} without alpha pre-multiplication. (The C++ API stores the colors in the order {alpha, red, green, blue} in native-endian ordering, with alpha pre-multiplication.)
These additional pixel formats have experimental support:

RGB24 Like RGBA32, but the 8 alpha bits are always opaque. This format is always used if the alpha context attribute is set to false (i.e. canvas.getContext('2d', {alpha: false})). This format can be faster than RGBA32 because transparency does not need to be calculated.
A8 Each pixel is 8 bits. This format can either be used for creating grayscale images (treating each byte as an alpha value), or for creating indexed PNGs (treating each byte as a palette index) (see the example using alpha values with fillStyle and the example using imageData).
RGB16_565 Each pixel is 16 bits, with red in the upper 5 bits, green in the middle 6 bits, and blue in the lower 5 bits, in native platform endianness. Some hardware devices and frame buffers use this format. Note that PNG does not support this format; when creating a PNG, the image will be converted to 24-bit RGB. This format is thus suboptimal for generating PNGs. ImageData instances for this mode use a Uint16Array instead of a Uint8ClampedArray.
A1 Each pixel is 1 bit, and pixels are packed together into 32-bit quantities. The ordering of the bits matches the endianness of the
platform: on a little-endian machine, the first pixel is the least-significant bit. This format can be used for creating single-color images. Support for this format is incomplete, see note below.
RGB30 Each pixel is 30 bits, with red in the upper 10, green in the middle 10, and blue in the lower 10. (Requires Cairo 1.12 or later.) Support for this format is incomplete, see note below.

Notes and caveats:


Using a non-default format can affect the behavior of APIs that involve pixel data:

context2d.createImageData The size of the array returned depends on the number of bit per pixel for the underlying image data format, per the above descriptions.
context2d.getImageData The format of the array returned depends on the underlying image mode, per the above descriptions. Be aware of platform endianness, which can be determined using node.js's os.endianness()
function.
context2d.putImageData As above.



A1 and RGB30 do not yet support getImageData or putImageData. Have a use case and/or opinion on working with these formats? Open an issue and let us know! (See #935.)


A1, A8, RGB30 and RGB16_565 with shadow blurs may crash or not render properly.


The ImageData(width, height) and ImageData(Uint8ClampedArray, width) constructors assume 4 bytes per pixel. To create an ImageData instance with a different number of bytes per pixel, use new ImageData(new Uint8ClampedArray(size), width, height) or new ImageData(new Uint16ClampedArray(size), width, height).


Testing
First make sure you've built the latest version. Get all the deps you need (see compiling above), and run:
npm install --build-from-source

For visual tests: npm run test-server and point your browser to http://localhost:4000.
For unit tests: npm run test.
Benchmarks
Benchmarks live in the benchmarks directory.
Examples
Examples line in the examples directory. Most produce a png image of the same name, and others such as live-clock.js launch an HTTP server to be viewed in the browser.

node-canvas is a Cairo-backed Canvas implementation for Node.js.
Installation
$ npm install canvas
By default, pre-built binaries will be downloaded if you're on one of the following platforms:

macOS x86/64
macOS aarch64 (aka Apple silicon)
Linux x86/64 (glibc only)
Windows x86/64

If you want to build from source, use npm install --build-from-source and see the Compiling section below.
The minimum version of Node.js required is 18.12.0.
Compiling
If you don't have a supported OS or processor architecture, or you use --build-from-source, the module will be compiled on your system. This requires several dependencies, including Cairo and Pango.
For detailed installation information, see the wiki. One-line installation instructions for common OSes are below. Note that libgif/giflib, librsvg and libjpeg are optional and only required if you need GIF, SVG and JPEG support, respectively. Cairo v1.10.0 or later is required.



OS
Command




macOS
Using Homebrew:brew install pkg-config cairo pango libpng jpeg giflib librsvg pixman python-setuptools


Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install build-essential libcairo2-dev libpango1.0-dev libjpeg-dev libgif-dev librsvg2-dev


Fedora
sudo yum install gcc-c++ cairo-devel pango-devel libjpeg-turbo-devel giflib-devel


Solaris
pkgin install cairo pango pkg-config xproto renderproto kbproto xextproto


OpenBSD

Others
See the wiki



Mac OS X v10.11+: If you have recently updated to Mac OS X v10.11+ and are experiencing trouble when compiling, run the following command: xcode-select --install. Read more about the problem on Stack Overflow.
If you have xcode 10.0 or higher installed, in order to build from source you need NPM 6.4.1 or higher.
Quick Example
const { createCanvas, loadImage } = require('canvas')
const canvas = createCanvas(200, 200)
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d')

// Write "Awesome!"
ctx.font = '30px Impact'
ctx.rotate(0.1)
ctx.fillText('Awesome!', 50, 100)

// Draw line under text
var text = ctx.measureText('Awesome!')
ctx.strokeStyle = 'rgba(0,0,0,0.5)'
ctx.beginPath()
ctx.lineTo(50, 102)
ctx.lineTo(50 + text.width, 102)
ctx.stroke()

// Draw cat with lime helmet
loadImage('examples/images/lime-cat.jpg').then((image) => {
  ctx.drawImage(image, 50, 0, 70, 70)

  console.log('<img src="' + canvas.toDataURL() + '" />')
})

createCanvas()

createCanvas(width: number, height: number, type?: 'PDF'|'SVG') => Canvas

Creates a Canvas instance. This method works in both Node.js and Web browsers, where there is no Canvas constructor. (See browser.js for the implementation that runs in browsers.)
const { createCanvas } = require('canvas')
const mycanvas = createCanvas(200, 200)
const myPDFcanvas = createCanvas(600, 800, 'pdf') // see "PDF Support" section
createImageData()

createImageData(width: number, height: number) => ImageData
createImageData(data: Uint8ClampedArray, width: number, height?: number) => ImageData
// for alternative pixel formats:
createImageData(data: Uint16Array, width: number, height?: number) => ImageData

Creates an ImageData instance. This method works in both Node.js and Web browsers.
const { createImageData } = require('canvas')
const width = 20, height = 20
const arraySize = width * height * 4
const mydata = createImageData(new Uint8ClampedArray(arraySize), width)
loadImage()

loadImage() => Promise<Image>

Convenience method for loading images. This method works in both Node.js and Web browsers.
const { loadImage } = require('canvas')
const myimg = loadImage('http://server.com/image.png')

myimg.then(() => {
  // do something with image
}).catch(err => {
  console.log('oh no!', err)
})

// or with async/await:
const myimg = await loadImage('http://server.com/image.png')
// do something with image
registerFont()

registerFont(path: string, { family: string, weight?: string, style?: string }) => void

To use a font file that is not installed as a system font, use registerFont() to register the font with Canvas.
const { registerFont, createCanvas } = require('canvas')
registerFont('comicsans.ttf', { family: 'Comic Sans' })

const canvas = createCanvas(500, 500)
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d')

ctx.font = '12px "Comic Sans"'
ctx.fillText('Everyone hates this font :(', 250, 10)
The second argument is an object with properties that resemble the CSS properties that are specified in @font-face rules. You must specify at least family. weight, and style are optional and default to 'normal'.
deregisterAllFonts()

deregisterAllFonts() => void

Use deregisterAllFonts to unregister all fonts that have been previously registered. This method is useful when you want to remove all registered fonts, such as when using the canvas in tests
const { registerFont, createCanvas, deregisterAllFonts } = require('canvas')

describe('text rendering', () => {
    afterEach(() => {
        deregisterAllFonts();
    })
    it('should render text with Comic Sans', () => {
        registerFont('comicsans.ttf', { family: 'Comic Sans' })

        const canvas = createCanvas(500, 500)
        const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d')
        
        ctx.font = '12px "Comic Sans"'
        ctx.fillText('Everyone loves this font :)', 250, 10)
        
        // assertScreenshot()
    })
})
Image#src

img.src: string|Buffer

As in browsers, img.src can be set to a data: URI or a remote URL. In addition, node-canvas allows setting src to a local file path or Buffer instance.
const { Image } = require('canvas')

// From a buffer:
fs.readFile('images/squid.png', (err, squid) => {
  if (err) throw err
  const img = new Image()
  img.onload = () => ctx.drawImage(img, 0, 0)
  img.onerror = err => { throw err }
  img.src = squid
})

// From a local file path:
const img = new Image()
img.onload = () => ctx.drawImage(img, 0, 0)
img.onerror = err => { throw err }
img.src = 'images/squid.png'

// From a remote URL:
img.src = 'http://picsum.photos/200/300'
// ... as above

// From a `data:` URI:
img.src = 'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAUAAAAFCAYAAACNbyblAAAAHElEQVQI12P4//8/w38GIAXDIBKE0DHxgljNBAAO9TXL0Y4OHwAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=='
// ... as above
Note: In some cases, img.src= is currently synchronous. However, you should always use img.onload and img.onerror, as we intend to make img.src= always asynchronous as it is in browsers. See #1007.
Image#dataMode

img.dataMode: number

Applies to JPEG images drawn to PDF canvases only.
Setting img.dataMode = Image.MODE_MIME or Image.MODE_MIME|Image.MODE_IMAGE enables MIME data tracking of images. When MIME data is tracked, PDF canvases can embed JPEGs directly into the output, rather than re-encoding into PNG. This can drastically reduce filesize and speed up rendering.
const { Image, createCanvas } = require('canvas')
const canvas = createCanvas(w, h, 'pdf')
const img = new Image()
img.dataMode = Image.MODE_IMAGE // Only image data tracked
img.dataMode = Image.MODE_MIME // Only mime data tracked
img.dataMode = Image.MODE_MIME | Image.MODE_IMAGE // Both are tracked
If working with a non-PDF canvas, image data must be tracked; otherwise the output will be junk.
Enabling mime data tracking has no benefits (only a slow down) unless you are generating a PDF.
Canvas#toBuffer()

canvas.toBuffer((err: Error|null, result: Buffer) => void, mimeType?: string, config?: any) => void
canvas.toBuffer(mimeType?: string, config?: any) => Buffer

Creates a Buffer object representing the image contained in the canvas.

callback If provided, the buffer will be provided in the callback instead of being returned by the function. Invoked with an error as the first argument if encoding failed, or the resulting buffer as the second argument if it succeeded. Not supported for mimeType raw or for PDF or SVG canvases.
mimeType A string indicating the image format. Valid options are image/png, image/jpeg (if node-canvas was built with JPEG support), raw (unencoded data in BGRA order on little-endian (most) systems, ARGB on big-endian systems; top-to-bottom), application/pdf (for PDF canvases) and image/svg+xml (for SVG canvases). Defaults to image/png for image canvases, or the corresponding type for PDF or SVG canvas.
config


For image/jpeg, an object specifying the quality (0 to 1), if progressive compression should be used and/or if chroma subsampling should be used: {quality: 0.75, progressive: false, chromaSubsampling: true}. All properties are optional.


For image/png, an object specifying the ZLIB compression level (between 0 and 9), the compression filter(s), the palette (indexed PNGs only), the the background palette index (indexed PNGs only) and/or the resolution (ppi): {compressionLevel: 6, filters: canvas.PNG_ALL_FILTERS, palette: undefined, backgroundIndex: 0, resolution: undefined}. All properties are optional.
Note that the PNG format encodes the resolution in pixels per meter, so if you specify 96, the file will encode 3780 ppm (~96.01 ppi). The resolution is undefined by default to match common browser behavior.


For application/pdf, an object specifying optional document metadata: {title: string, author: string, subject: string, keywords: string, creator: string, creationDate: Date, modDate: Date}. All properties are optional and default to undefined, except for creationDate, which defaults to the current date. Adding metadata requires Cairo 1.16.0 or later.
For a description of these properties, see page 550 of PDF 32000-1:2008.
Note that there is no standard separator for keywords. A space is recommended because it is in common use by other applications, and Cairo will enclose the list of keywords in quotes if a comma or semicolon is used.




Return value
If no callback is provided, a Buffer. If a callback is provided, none.
Examples
// Default: buf contains a PNG-encoded image
const buf = canvas.toBuffer()

// PNG-encoded, zlib compression level 3 for faster compression but bigger files, no filtering
const buf2 = canvas.toBuffer('image/png', { compressionLevel: 3, filters: canvas.PNG_FILTER_NONE })

// JPEG-encoded, 50% quality
const buf3 = canvas.toBuffer('image/jpeg', { quality: 0.5 })

// Asynchronous PNG
canvas.toBuffer((err, buf) => {
  if (err) throw err // encoding failed
  // buf is PNG-encoded image
})

canvas.toBuffer((err, buf) => {
  if (err) throw err // encoding failed
  // buf is JPEG-encoded image at 95% quality
}, 'image/jpeg', { quality: 0.95 })

// BGRA pixel values, native-endian
const buf4 = canvas.toBuffer('raw')
const { stride, width } = canvas
// In memory, this is `canvas.height * canvas.stride` bytes long.
// The top row of pixels, in BGRA order on little-endian hardware,
// left-to-right, is:
const topPixelsBGRALeftToRight = buf4.slice(0, width * 4)
// And the third row is:
const row3 = buf4.slice(2 * stride, 2 * stride + width * 4)

// SVG and PDF canvases
const myCanvas = createCanvas(w, h, 'pdf')
myCanvas.toBuffer() // returns a buffer containing a PDF-encoded canvas
// With optional metadata:
myCanvas.toBuffer('application/pdf', {
  title: 'my picture',
  keywords: 'node.js demo cairo',
  creationDate: new Date()
})
Canvas#createPNGStream()

canvas.createPNGStream(config?: any) => ReadableStream

Creates a ReadableStream that emits PNG-encoded data.

config An object specifying the ZLIB compression level (between 0 and 9), the compression filter(s), the palette (indexed PNGs only) and/or the background palette index (indexed PNGs only): {compressionLevel: 6, filters: canvas.PNG_ALL_FILTERS, palette: undefined, backgroundIndex: 0, resolution: undefined}. All properties are optional.

Examples
const fs = require('fs')
const out = fs.createWriteStream(__dirname + '/test.png')
const stream = canvas.createPNGStream()
stream.pipe(out)
out.on('finish', () =>  console.log('The PNG file was created.'))
To encode indexed PNGs from canvases with pixelFormat: 'A8' or 'A1', provide an options object:
const palette = new Uint8ClampedArray([
  //r    g    b    a
    0,  50,  50, 255, // index 1
   10,  90,  90, 255, // index 2
  127, 127, 255, 255
  // ...
])
canvas.createPNGStream({
  palette: palette,
  backgroundIndex: 0 // optional, defaults to 0
})
Canvas#createJPEGStream()

canvas.createJPEGStream(config?: any) => ReadableStream

Creates a ReadableStream that emits JPEG-encoded data.
Note: At the moment, createJPEGStream() is synchronous under the hood. That is, it runs in the main thread, not in the libuv threadpool.

config an object specifying the quality (0 to 1), if progressive compression should be used and/or if chroma subsampling should be used: {quality: 0.75, progressive: false, chromaSubsampling: true}. All properties are optional.

Examples
const fs = require('fs')
const out = fs.createWriteStream(__dirname + '/test.jpeg')
const stream = canvas.createJPEGStream()
stream.pipe(out)
out.on('finish', () =>  console.log('The JPEG file was created.'))

// Disable 2x2 chromaSubsampling for deeper colors and use a higher quality
const stream = canvas.createJPEGStream({
  quality: 0.95,
  chromaSubsampling: false
})
Canvas#createPDFStream()

canvas.createPDFStream(config?: any) => ReadableStream


config an object specifying optional document metadata: {title: string, author: string, subject: string, keywords: string, creator: string, creationDate: Date, modDate: Date}. See toBuffer() for more information. Adding metadata requires Cairo 1.16.0 or later.

Applies to PDF canvases only. Creates a ReadableStream that emits the encoded PDF. canvas.toBuffer() also produces an encoded PDF, but createPDFStream() can be used to reduce memory usage.
Canvas#toDataURL()
This is a standard API, but several non-standard calls are supported. The full list of supported calls is:
dataUrl = canvas.toDataURL() // defaults to PNG
dataUrl = canvas.toDataURL('image/png')
dataUrl = canvas.toDataURL('image/jpeg')
dataUrl = canvas.toDataURL('image/jpeg', quality) // quality from 0 to 1
canvas.toDataURL((err, png) => { }) // defaults to PNG
canvas.toDataURL('image/png', (err, png) => { })
canvas.toDataURL('image/jpeg', (err, jpeg) => { }) // sync JPEG is not supported
canvas.toDataURL('image/jpeg', {...opts}, (err, jpeg) => { }) // see Canvas#createJPEGStream for valid options
canvas.toDataURL('image/jpeg', quality, (err, jpeg) => { }) // spec-following; quality from 0 to 1
CanvasRenderingContext2D#patternQuality

context.patternQuality: 'fast'|'good'|'best'|'nearest'|'bilinear'

Defaults to 'good'. Affects pattern (gradient, image, etc.) rendering quality.
CanvasRenderingContext2D#quality

context.quality: 'fast'|'good'|'best'|'nearest'|'bilinear'

Defaults to 'good'. Like patternQuality, but applies to transformations affecting more than just patterns.
CanvasRenderingContext2D#textDrawingMode

context.textDrawingMode: 'path'|'glyph'

Defaults to 'path'. The effect depends on the canvas type:


Standard (image) glyph and path both result in rasterized text. Glyph mode is faster than path, but may result in lower-quality text, especially when rotated or translated.


PDF glyph will embed text instead of paths into the PDF. This is faster to encode, faster to open with PDF viewers, yields a smaller file size and makes the text selectable. The subset of the font needed to render the glyphs will be embedded in the PDF. This is usually the mode you want to use with PDF canvases.


SVG glyph does not cause <text> elements to be produced as one might expect (cairo bug). Rather, glyph will create a <defs> section with a <symbol> for each glyph, then those glyphs be reused via <use> elements. path mode creates a <path> element for each text string. glyph mode is faster and yields a smaller file size.


In glyph mode, ctx.strokeText() and ctx.fillText() behave the same (aside from using the stroke and fill style, respectively).
This property is tracked as part of the canvas state in save/restore.
CanvasRenderingContext2D#globalCompositeOperation = 'saturate'
In addition to all of the standard global composite operations defined by the Canvas specification, the 'saturate' operation is also available.
CanvasRenderingContext2D#antialias

context.antialias: 'default'|'none'|'gray'|'subpixel'

Sets the anti-aliasing mode.
PDF Output Support
node-canvas can create PDF documents instead of images. The canvas type must be set when creating the canvas as follows:
const canvas = createCanvas(200, 500, 'pdf')
An additional method .addPage() is then available to create multiple page PDFs:
// On first page
ctx.font = '22px Helvetica'
ctx.fillText('Hello World', 50, 80)

ctx.addPage()
// Now on second page
ctx.font = '22px Helvetica'
ctx.fillText('Hello World 2', 50, 80)

canvas.toBuffer() // returns a PDF file
canvas.createPDFStream() // returns a ReadableStream that emits a PDF
// With optional document metadata (requires Cairo 1.16.0):
canvas.toBuffer('application/pdf', {
  title: 'my picture',
  keywords: 'node.js demo cairo',
  creationDate: new Date()
})
It is also possible to create pages with different sizes by passing width and height to the .addPage() method:
ctx.font = '22px Helvetica'
ctx.fillText('Hello World', 50, 80)
ctx.addPage(400, 800)

ctx.fillText('Hello World 2', 50, 80)
It is possible to add hyperlinks using .beginTag() and .endTag():
ctx.beginTag('Link', "uri='https://google.com'")
ctx.font = '22px Helvetica'
ctx.fillText('Hello World', 50, 80)
ctx.endTag('Link')
Or with a defined rectangle:
ctx.beginTag('Link', "uri='https://google.com' rect=[50 80 100 20]")
ctx.endTag('Link')
Note that the syntax for attributes is unique to Cairo. See cairo_tag_begin for the full documentation.
You can create areas on the canvas using the "cairo.dest" tag, and then link to them using the "Link" tag with the dest= attribute. You can also define PDF structure for accessibility by using tag names like "P", "H1", and "TABLE". The standard tags are defined in §14.8.4 of the PDF 1.7 specification.

Canvas#createPDFStream() for creating PDF streams
CanvasRenderingContext2D#textDrawingMode
for embedding text instead of paths

SVG Output Support
node-canvas can create SVG documents instead of images. The canvas type must be set when creating the canvas as follows:
const canvas = createCanvas(200, 500, 'svg')
// Use the normal primitives.
fs.writeFileSync('out.svg', canvas.toBuffer())
SVG Image Support
If librsvg is available when node-canvas is installed, node-canvas can render SVG images to your canvas context. This currently works by rasterizing the SVG image (i.e. drawing an SVG image to an SVG canvas will not preserve the SVG data).
const img = new Image()
img.onload = () => ctx.drawImage(img, 0, 0)
img.onerror = err => { throw err }
img.src = './example.svg'
Image pixel formats (experimental)
node-canvas has experimental support for additional pixel formats, roughly following the Canvas color space proposal.
const canvas = createCanvas(200, 200)
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d', { pixelFormat: 'A8' })
By default, canvases are created in the RGBA32 format, which corresponds to the native HTML Canvas behavior. Each pixel is 32 bits. The JavaScript APIs that involve pixel data (getImageData, putImageData) store the colors in the order {red, green, blue, alpha} without alpha pre-multiplication. (The C++ API stores the colors in the order {alpha, red, green, blue} in native-endian ordering, with alpha pre-multiplication.)
These additional pixel formats have experimental support:

RGB24 Like RGBA32, but the 8 alpha bits are always opaque. This format is always used if the alpha context attribute is set to false (i.e. canvas.getContext('2d', {alpha: false})). This format can be faster than RGBA32 because transparency does not need to be calculated.
A8 Each pixel is 8 bits. This format can either be used for creating grayscale images (treating each byte as an alpha value), or for creating indexed PNGs (treating each byte as a palette index) (see the example using alpha values with fillStyle and the example using imageData).
RGB16_565 Each pixel is 16 bits, with red in the upper 5 bits, green in the middle 6 bits, and blue in the lower 5 bits, in native platform endianness. Some hardware devices and frame buffers use this format. Note that PNG does not support this format; when creating a PNG, the image will be converted to 24-bit RGB. This format is thus suboptimal for generating PNGs. ImageData instances for this mode use a Uint16Array instead of a Uint8ClampedArray.
A1 Each pixel is 1 bit, and pixels are packed together into 32-bit quantities. The ordering of the bits matches the endianness of the
platform: on a little-endian machine, the first pixel is the least-significant bit. This format can be used for creating single-color images. Support for this format is incomplete, see note below.
RGB30 Each pixel is 30 bits, with red in the upper 10, green in the middle 10, and blue in the lower 10. (Requires Cairo 1.12 or later.) Support for this format is incomplete, see note below.

Notes and caveats:


Using a non-default format can affect the behavior of APIs that involve pixel data:

context2d.createImageData The size of the array returned depends on the number of bit per pixel for the underlying image data format, per the above descriptions.
context2d.getImageData The format of the array returned depends on the underlying image mode, per the above descriptions. Be aware of platform endianness, which can be determined using node.js's os.endianness()
function.
context2d.putImageData As above.



A1 and RGB30 do not yet support getImageData or putImageData. Have a use case and/or opinion on working with these formats? Open an issue and let us know! (See #935.)


A1, A8, RGB30 and RGB16_565 with shadow blurs may crash or not render properly.


The ImageData(width, height) and ImageData(Uint8ClampedArray, width) constructors assume 4 bytes per pixel. To create an ImageData instance with a different number of bytes per pixel, use new ImageData(new Uint8ClampedArray(size), width, height) or new ImageData(new Uint16ClampedArray(size), width, height).


Testing
First make sure you've built the latest version. Get all the deps you need (see compiling above), and run:
npm install --build-from-source

For visual tests: npm run test-server and point your browser to http://localhost:4000.
For unit tests: npm run test.
Benchmarks
Benchmarks live in the benchmarks directory.
Examples
Examples line in the examples directory. Most produce a png image of the same name, and others such as live-clock.js launch an HTTP server to be viewed in the browser.

node-canvas is a Cairo-backed Canvas implementation for Node.js.
Installation
$ npm install canvas
By default, pre-built binaries will be downloaded if you're on one of the following platforms:

macOS x86/64
macOS aarch64 (aka Apple silicon)
Linux x86/64 (glibc only)
Windows x86/64

If you want to build from source, use npm install --build-from-source and see the Compiling section below.
The minimum version of Node.js required is 18.12.0.
Compiling
If you don't have a supported OS or processor architecture, or you use --build-from-source, the module will be compiled on your system. This requires several dependencies, including Cairo and Pango.
For detailed installation information, see the wiki. One-line installation instructions for common OSes are below. Note that libgif/giflib, librsvg and libjpeg are optional and only required if you need GIF, SVG and JPEG support, respectively. Cairo v1.10.0 or later is required.



OS
Command




macOS
Using Homebrew:brew install pkg-config cairo pango libpng jpeg giflib librsvg pixman python-setuptools


Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install build-essential libcairo2-dev libpango1.0-dev libjpeg-dev libgif-dev librsvg2-dev


Fedora
sudo yum install gcc-c++ cairo-devel pango-devel libjpeg-turbo-devel giflib-devel


Solaris
pkgin install cairo pango pkg-config xproto renderproto kbproto xextproto

Mac OS X v10.11+: If you have recently updated to Mac OS X v10.11+ and are experiencing trouble when compiling, run the following command: xcode-select --install. Read more about the problem on Stack Overflow.
If you have xcode 10.0 or higher installed, in order to build from source you need NPM 6.4.1 or higher.
Quick Example
const { createCanvas, loadImage } = require('canvas')
const canvas = createCanvas(200, 200)
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d')

// Write "Awesome!"
ctx.font = '30px Impact'
ctx.rotate(0.1)
ctx.fillText('Awesome!', 50, 100)

// Draw line under text
var text = ctx.measureText('Awesome!')
ctx.strokeStyle = 'rgba(0,0,0,0.5)'
ctx.beginPath()
ctx.lineTo(50, 102)
ctx.lineTo(50 + text.width, 102)
ctx.stroke()

// Draw cat with lime helmet
loadImage('examples/images/lime-cat.jpg').then((image) => {
  ctx.drawImage(image, 50, 0, 70, 70)

  console.log('<img src="' + canvas.toDataURL() + '" />')
})

createCanvas()

createCanvas(width: number, height: number, type?: 'PDF'|'SVG') => Canvas

Creates a Canvas instance. This method works in both Node.js and Web browsers, where there is no Canvas constructor. (See browser.js for the implementation that runs in browsers.)
const { createCanvas } = require('canvas')
const mycanvas = createCanvas(200, 200)
const myPDFcanvas = createCanvas(600, 800, 'pdf') // see "PDF Support" section
createImageData()

createImageData(width: number, height: number) => ImageData
createImageData(data: Uint8ClampedArray, width: number, height?: number) => ImageData
// for alternative pixel formats:
createImageData(data: Uint16Array, width: number, height?: number) => ImageData

Creates an ImageData instance. This method works in both Node.js and Web browsers.
const { createImageData } = require('canvas')
const width = 20, height = 20
const arraySize = width * height * 4
const mydata = createImageData(new Uint8ClampedArray(arraySize), width)
loadImage()

loadImage() => Promise<Image>

Convenience method for loading images. This method works in both Node.js and Web browsers.
const { loadImage } = require('canvas')
const myimg = loadImage('http://server.com/image.png')

myimg.then(() => {
  // do something with image
}).catch(err => {
  console.log('oh no!', err)
})

// or with async/await:
const myimg = await loadImage('http://server.com/image.png')
// do something with image
registerFont()

registerFont(path: string, { family: string, weight?: string, style?: string }) => void

To use a font file that is not installed as a system font, use registerFont() to register the font with Canvas.
const { registerFont, createCanvas } = require('canvas')
registerFont('comicsans.ttf', { family: 'Comic Sans' })

const canvas = createCanvas(500, 500)
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d')

ctx.font = '12px "Comic Sans"'
ctx.fillText('Everyone hates this font :(', 250, 10)
The second argument is an object with properties that resemble the CSS properties that are specified in @font-face rules. You must specify at least family. weight, and style are optional and default to 'normal'.
deregisterAllFonts()

deregisterAllFonts() => void

Use deregisterAllFonts to unregister all fonts that have been previously registered. This method is useful when you want to remove all registered fonts, such as when using the canvas in tests
const { registerFont, createCanvas, deregisterAllFonts } = require('canvas')

describe('text rendering', () => {
    afterEach(() => {
        deregisterAllFonts();
    })
    it('should render text with Comic Sans', () => {
        registerFont('comicsans.ttf', { family: 'Comic Sans' })

        const canvas = createCanvas(500, 500)
        const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d')
        
        ctx.font = '12px "Comic Sans"'
        ctx.fillText('Everyone loves this font :)', 250, 10)
        
        // assertScreenshot()
    })
})
Image#src

img.src: string|Buffer

As in browsers, img.src can be set to a data: URI or a remote URL. In addition, node-canvas allows setting src to a local file path or Buffer instance.
const { Image } = require('canvas')

// From a buffer:
fs.readFile('images/squid.png', (err, squid) => {
  if (err) throw err
  const img = new Image()
  img.onload = () => ctx.drawImage(img, 0, 0)
  img.onerror = err => { throw err }
  img.src = squid
})

// From a local file path:
const img = new Image()
img.onload = () => ctx.drawImage(img, 0, 0)
img.onerror = err => { throw err }
img.src = 'images/squid.png'

// From a remote URL:
img.src = 'http://picsum.photos/200/300'
// ... as above

// From a `data:` URI:
img.src = 'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAUAAAAFCAYAAACNbyblAAAAHElEQVQI12P4//8/w38GIAXDIBKE0DHxgljNBAAO9TXL0Y4OHwAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=='
// ... as above
Note: In some cases, img.src= is currently synchronous. However, you should always use img.onload and img.onerror, as we intend to make img.src= always asynchronous as it is in browsers. See #1007.
Image#dataMode

img.dataMode: number

Applies to JPEG images drawn to PDF canvases only.
Setting img.dataMode = Image.MODE_MIME or Image.MODE_MIME|Image.MODE_IMAGE enables MIME data tracking of images. When MIME data is tracked, PDF canvases can embed JPEGs directly into the output, rather than re-encoding into PNG. This can drastically reduce filesize and speed up rendering.
const { Image, createCanvas } = require('canvas')
const canvas = createCanvas(w, h, 'pdf')
const img = new Image()
img.dataMode = Image.MODE_IMAGE // Only image data tracked
img.dataMode = Image.MODE_MIME // Only mime data tracked
img.dataMode = Image.MODE_MIME | Image.MODE_IMAGE // Both are tracked
If working with a non-PDF canvas, image data must be tracked; otherwise the output will be junk.
Enabling mime data tracking has no benefits (only a slow down) unless you are generating a PDF.
Canvas#toBuffer()

canvas.toBuffer((err: Error|null, result: Buffer) => void, mimeType?: string, config?: any) => void
canvas.toBuffer(mimeType?: string, config?: any) => Buffer

Creates a Buffer object representing the image contained in the canvas.

callback If provided, the buffer will be provided in the callback instead of being returned by the function. Invoked with an error as the first argument if encoding failed, or the resulting buffer as the second argument if it succeeded. Not supported for mimeType raw or for PDF or SVG canvases.
mimeType A string indicating the image format. Valid options are image/png, image/jpeg (if node-canvas was built with JPEG support), raw (unencoded data in BGRA order on little-endian (most) systems, ARGB on big-endian systems; top-to-bottom), application/pdf (for PDF canvases) and image/svg+xml (for SVG canvases). Defaults to image/png for image canvases, or the corresponding type for PDF or SVG canvas.
config


For image/jpeg, an object specifying the quality (0 to 1), if progressive compression should be used and/or if chroma subsampling should be used: {quality: 0.75, progressive: false, chromaSubsampling: true}. All properties are optional.


For image/png, an object specifying the ZLIB compression level (between 0 and 9), the compression filter(s), the palette (indexed PNGs only), the the background palette index (indexed PNGs only) and/or the resolution (ppi): {compressionLevel: 6, filters: canvas.PNG_ALL_FILTERS, palette: undefined, backgroundIndex: 0, resolution: undefined}. All properties are optional.
Note that the PNG format encodes the resolution in pixels per meter, so if you specify 96, the file will encode 3780 ppm (~96.01 ppi). The resolution is undefined by default to match common browser behavior.


For application/pdf, an object specifying optional document metadata: {title: string, author: string, subject: string, keywords: string, creator: string, creationDate: Date, modDate: Date}. All properties are optional and default to undefined, except for creationDate, which defaults to the current date. Adding metadata requires Cairo 1.16.0 or later.
For a description of these properties, see page 550 of PDF 32000-1:2008.
Note that there is no standard separator for keywords. A space is recommended because it is in common use by other applications, and Cairo will enclose the list of keywords in quotes if a comma or semicolon is used.




Return value
If no callback is provided, a Buffer. If a callback is provided, none.
Examples
// Default: buf contains a PNG-encoded image
const buf = canvas.toBuffer()

// PNG-encoded, zlib compression level 3 for faster compression but bigger files, no filtering
const buf2 = canvas.toBuffer('image/png', { compressionLevel: 3, filters: canvas.PNG_FILTER_NONE })

// JPEG-encoded, 50% quality
const buf3 = canvas.toBuffer('image/jpeg', { quality: 0.5 })

// Asynchronous PNG
canvas.toBuffer((err, buf) => {
  if (err) throw err // encoding failed
  // buf is PNG-encoded image
})

canvas.toBuffer((err, buf) => {
  if (err) throw err // encoding failed
  // buf is JPEG-encoded image at 95% quality
}, 'image/jpeg', { quality: 0.95 })

// BGRA pixel values, native-endian
const buf4 = canvas.toBuffer('raw')
const { stride, width } = canvas
// In memory, this is `canvas.height * canvas.stride` bytes long.
// The top row of pixels, in BGRA order on little-endian hardware,
// left-to-right, is:
const topPixelsBGRALeftToRight = buf4.slice(0, width * 4)
// And the third row is:
const row3 = buf4.slice(2 * stride, 2 * stride + width * 4)

// SVG and PDF canvases
const myCanvas = createCanvas(w, h, 'pdf')
myCanvas.toBuffer() // returns a buffer containing a PDF-encoded canvas
// With optional metadata:
myCanvas.toBuffer('application/pdf', {
  title: 'my picture',
  keywords: 'node.js demo cairo',
  creationDate: new Date()
})
Canvas#createPNGStream()

canvas.createPNGStream(config?: any) => ReadableStream

Creates a ReadableStream that emits PNG-encoded data.

config An object specifying the ZLIB compression level (between 0 and 9), the compression filter(s), the palette (indexed PNGs only) and/or the background palette index (indexed PNGs only): {compressionLevel: 6, filters: canvas.PNG_ALL_FILTERS, palette: undefined, backgroundIndex: 0, resolution: undefined}. All properties are optional.

Examples
const fs = require('fs')
const out = fs.createWriteStream(__dirname + '/test.png')
const stream = canvas.createPNGStream()
stream.pipe(out)
out.on('finish', () =>  console.log('The PNG file was created.'))
To encode indexed PNGs from canvases with pixelFormat: 'A8' or 'A1', provide an options object:
const palette = new Uint8ClampedArray([
  //r    g    b    a
    0,  50,  50, 255, // index 1
   10,  90,  90, 255, // index 2
  127, 127, 255, 255
  // ...
])
canvas.createPNGStream({
  palette: palette,
  backgroundIndex: 0 // optional, defaults to 0
})
Canvas#createJPEGStream()

canvas.createJPEGStream(config?: any) => ReadableStream

Creates a ReadableStream that emits JPEG-encoded data.
Note: At the moment, createJPEGStream() is synchronous under the hood. That is, it runs in the main thread, not in the libuv threadpool.

config an object specifying the quality (0 to 1), if progressive compression should be used and/or if chroma subsampling should be used: {quality: 0.75, progressive: false, chromaSubsampling: true}. All properties are optional.

Examples
const fs = require('fs')
const out = fs.createWriteStream(__dirname + '/test.jpeg')
const stream = canvas.createJPEGStream()
stream.pipe(out)
out.on('finish', () =>  console.log('The JPEG file was created.'))

// Disable 2x2 chromaSubsampling for deeper colors and use a higher quality
const stream = canvas.createJPEGStream({
  quality: 0.95,
  chromaSubsampling: false
})
Canvas#createPDFStream()

canvas.createPDFStream(config?: any) => ReadableStream


config an object specifying optional document metadata: {title: string, author: string, subject: string, keywords: string, creator: string, creationDate: Date, modDate: Date}. See toBuffer() for more information. Adding metadata requires Cairo 1.16.0 or later.

Applies to PDF canvases only. Creates a ReadableStream that emits the encoded PDF. canvas.toBuffer() also produces an encoded PDF, but createPDFStream() can be used to reduce memory usage.
Canvas#toDataURL()
This is a standard API, but several non-standard calls are supported. The full list of supported calls is:
dataUrl = canvas.toDataURL() // defaults to PNG
dataUrl = canvas.toDataURL('image/png')
dataUrl = canvas.toDataURL('image/jpeg')
dataUrl = canvas.toDataURL('image/jpeg', quality) // quality from 0 to 1
canvas.toDataURL((err, png) => { }) // defaults to PNG
canvas.toDataURL('image/png', (err, png) => { })
canvas.toDataURL('image/jpeg', (err, jpeg) => { }) // sync JPEG is not supported
canvas.toDataURL('image/jpeg', {...opts}, (err, jpeg) => { }) // see Canvas#createJPEGStream for valid options
canvas.toDataURL('image/jpeg', quality, (err, jpeg) => { }) // spec-following; quality from 0 to 1
CanvasRenderingContext2D#patternQuality

context.patternQuality: 'fast'|'good'|'best'|'nearest'|'bilinear'

Defaults to 'good'. Affects pattern (gradient, image, etc.) rendering quality.
CanvasRenderingContext2D#quality

context.quality: 'fast'|'good'|'best'|'nearest'|'bilinear'

Defaults to 'good'. Like patternQuality, but applies to transformations affecting more than just patterns.
CanvasRenderingContext2D#textDrawingMode

context.textDrawingMode: 'path'|'glyph'

Defaults to 'path'. The effect depends on the canvas type:


Standard (image) glyph and path both result in rasterized text. Glyph mode is faster than path, but may result in lower-quality text, especially when rotated or translated.


PDF glyph will embed text instead of paths into the PDF. This is faster to encode, faster to open with PDF viewers, yields a smaller file size and makes the text selectable. The subset of the font needed to render the glyphs will be embedded in the PDF. This is usually the mode you want to use with PDF canvases.


SVG glyph does not cause <text> elements to be produced as one might expect (cairo bug). Rather, glyph will create a <defs> section with a <symbol> for each glyph, then those glyphs be reused via <use> elements. path mode creates a <path> element for each text string. glyph mode is faster and yields a smaller file size.


In glyph mode, ctx.strokeText() and ctx.fillText() behave the same (aside from using the stroke and fill style, respectively).
This property is tracked as part of the canvas state in save/restore.
CanvasRenderingContext2D#globalCompositeOperation = 'saturate'
In addition to all of the standard global composite operations defined by the Canvas specification, the 'saturate' operation is also available.
CanvasRenderingContext2D#antialias

context.antialias: 'default'|'none'|'gray'|'subpixel'

Sets the anti-aliasing mode.
PDF Output Support
node-canvas can create PDF documents instead of images. The canvas type must be set when creating the canvas as follows:
const canvas = createCanvas(200, 500, 'pdf')
An additional method .addPage() is then available to create multiple page PDFs:
// On first page
ctx.font = '22px Helvetica'
ctx.fillText('Hello World', 50, 80)

ctx.addPage()
// Now on second page
ctx.font = '22px Helvetica'
ctx.fillText('Hello World 2', 50, 80)

canvas.toBuffer() // returns a PDF file
canvas.createPDFStream() // returns a ReadableStream that emits a PDF
// With optional document metadata (requires Cairo 1.16.0):
canvas.toBuffer('application/pdf', {
  title: 'my picture',
  keywords: 'node.js demo cairo',
  creationDate: new Date()
})
It is also possible to create pages with different sizes by passing width and height to the .addPage() method:
ctx.font = '22px Helvetica'
ctx.fillText('Hello World', 50, 80)
ctx.addPage(400, 800)

ctx.fillText('Hello World 2', 50, 80)
It is possible to add hyperlinks using .beginTag() and .endTag():
ctx.beginTag('Link', "uri='https://google.com'")
ctx.font = '22px Helvetica'
ctx.fillText('Hello World', 50, 80)
ctx.endTag('Link')
Or with a defined rectangle:
ctx.beginTag('Link', "uri='https://google.com' rect=[50 80 100 20]")
ctx.endTag('Link')
Note that the syntax for attributes is unique to Cairo. See cairo_tag_begin for the full documentation.
You can create areas on the canvas using the "cairo.dest" tag, and then link to them using the "Link" tag with the dest= attribute. You can also define PDF structure for accessibility by using tag names like "P", "H1", and "TABLE". The standard tags are defined in §14.8.4 of the PDF 1.7 specification.

SVG Output Support
node-canvas can create SVG documents instead of images. The canvas type must be set when creating the canvas as follows:
const canvas = createCanvas(200, 500, 'svg')
// Use the normal primitives.
fs.writeFileSync('out.svg', canvas.toBuffer())
SVG Image Support
If librsvg is available when node-canvas is installed, node-canvas can render SVG images to your canvas context. This currently works by rasterizing the SVG image (i.e. drawing an SVG image to an SVG canvas will not preserve the SVG data).
const img = new Image()
img.onload = () => ctx.drawImage(img, 0, 0)
img.onerror = err => { throw err }
img.src = './example.svg'
Image pixel formats (experimental)
node-canvas has experimental support for additional pixel formats, roughly following the Canvas color space proposal.
const canvas = createCanvas(200, 200)
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d', { pixelFormat: 'A8' })
By default, canvases are created in the RGBA32 format, which corresponds to the native HTML Canvas behavior. Each pixel is 32 bits. The JavaScript APIs that involve pixel data (getImageData, putImageData) store the colors in the order {red, green, blue, alpha} without alpha pre-multiplication. (The C++ API stores the colors in the order {alpha, red, green, blue} in native-endian ordering, with alpha pre-multiplication.)
These additional pixel formats have experimental support:

RGB24 Like RGBA32, but the 8 alpha bits are always opaque. This format is always used if the alpha context attribute is set to false (i.e. canvas.getContext('2d', {alpha: false})). This format can be faster than RGBA32 because transparency does not need to be calculated.
A8 Each pixel is 8 bits. This format can either be used for creating grayscale images (treating each byte as an alpha value), or for creating indexed PNGs (treating each byte as a palette index) (see the example using alpha values with fillStyle and the example using imageData).
RGB16_565 Each pixel is 16 bits, with red in the upper 5 bits, green in the middle 6 bits, and blue in the lower 5 bits, in native platform endianness. Some hardware devices and frame buffers use this format. Note that PNG does not support this format; when creating a PNG, the image will be converted to 24-bit RGB. This format is thus suboptimal for generating PNGs. ImageData instances for this mode use a Uint16Array instead of a Uint8ClampedArray.
A1 Each pixel is 1 bit, and pixels are packed together into 32-bit quantities. The ordering of the bits matches the endianness of the
platform: on a little-endian machine, the first pixel is the least-significant bit. This format can be used for creating single-color images. Support for this format is incomplete, see note below.
RGB30 Each pixel is 30 bits, with red in the upper 10, green in the middle 10, and blue in the lower 10. (Requires Cairo 1.12 or later.) Support for this format is incomplete, see note below.

Notes and caveats:


Using a non-default format can affect the behavior of APIs that involve pixel data:

context2d.createImageData The size of the array returned depends on the number of bit per pixel for the underlying image data format, per the above descriptions.
context2d.getImageData The format of the array returned depends on the underlying image mode, per the above descriptions. Be aware of platform endianness, which can be determined using node.js's os.endianness()
function.
context2d.putImageData As above.



A1 and RGB30 do not yet support getImageData or putImageData. Have a use case and/or opinion on working with these formats? Open an issue and let us know! (See #935.)


A1, A8, RGB30 and RGB16_565 with shadow blurs may crash or not render properly.


The ImageData(width, height) and ImageData(Uint8ClampedArray, width) constructors assume 4 bytes per pixel. To create an ImageData instance with a different number of bytes per pixel, use new ImageData(new Uint8ClampedArray(size), width, height) or new ImageData(new Uint16ClampedArray(size), width, height).


Testing
First make sure you've built the latest version. Get all the deps you need (see compiling above), and run:
npm install --build-from-source

For visual tests: npm run test-server and point your browser to http://localhost:4000.
For unit tests: npm run test.
Benchmarks
Benchmarks live in the benchmarks directory.
Examples
Examples line in the examples directory. Most produce a png image of the same name, and others such as live-clock.js launch an HTTP server to be viewed in the browser.

Backed by the leaders in AI, GitHub Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With GitHub Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on: value, innovation, and happiness.GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use GitHub Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, GitHub Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, student, faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead. 
What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains, and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create GitHub Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.To generate a code suggestion, the GitHub Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to GitHub Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the GitHub Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to GitHub Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, GitHub Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to GitHub Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.  What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with GitHub Copilot throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in GitHub Advanced Security.What if I do not want GitHub Copilot?GitHub Copilot is entirely optional and requires you to opt in before gaining access. You can easily configure its usage directly in the editor, enabling or disabling it at any time.

All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.GitHub Copilot Pro is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.How can I upgrade my GitHub Copilot Free license to Copilot Pro?If you're on the Free plan, you can upgrade to Pro through your Copilot settings page or directly on the Copilot marketing page.What is included in GitHub Copilot Free?GitHub Copilot Free users are limited to 2000 completions and 50 chat requests (including Copilot Edits).Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in GitHub Advanced Security and available to all public repositories.PrivacyWhat personal data does GitHub Copilot process?GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:User Engagement Data: This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics. Prompts: These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions. Suggestions: These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts. Feedback Data: This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models. How does GitHub use the Copilot data?How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendationsTroubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-datenessEnhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operationalThese practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement (DPA), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers. GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:Billing and account managementTo comply with and resolve legal obligations For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of serviceTo generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentivesTo produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the GitHub Privacy Statement.How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers? If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows: Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:Prompts and Suggestions: Not retainedUser Engagement Data: Kept for two years.Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.All other GitHub Copilot access and use:Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions. Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a Data Protection Agreement that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals. How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the GitHub Privacy Statement.
Responsible AIWhat are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations. With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a code referencing feature as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or                        idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also                        synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that                        either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including hardcoded credentials, SQL injections, and path injections. Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective                        risk tolerances.As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment for more details.Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with                        disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our feedback forum.Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid                        synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter                        system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found here.Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.GeneralPlans & pricingPrivacyResponsible AIGeneralWhat is GitHub Copilot?GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, GitHub Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With GitHub Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on: value, innovation, and happiness.GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use GitHub Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, GitHub Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, student, faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead. 
What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains, and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create GitHub Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.To generate a code suggestion, the GitHub Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to GitHub Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the GitHub Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to GitHub Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, GitHub Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to GitHub Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.  What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers.

Responsible AIWhat are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method.

GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective                        risk tolerances.As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment for more details.Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with                        disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our feedback forum.Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid                        synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter                        system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found here.Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans.

GitHub Models brings AI directly into the developer workflow by providing access to multiple leading models through a single API key. It allows teams to manage prompts as code, run side-by-side model evaluations, and move from testing to production within the same environment they already use.
Is GitHub Models different from GitHub Copilot?Yes, GitHub Models is a separate product, outside of GitHub Copilot. GitHub Models is free for everyone to get started building AI with and can be leveraged directly within GitHub. What is the Models Playground?GitHub Models includes a playground where you can explore a curated selection of AI models from providers like OpenAI, Meta, and Microsoft. There you can experiment with prompts, tweak parameters (such as temperature or max tokens), and see how different models respond, all in real time.\n\n\n\nGitHub SecurityAdvanced SecuritySecret ProtectionCode SecuritySupply Chain SecurityPlans & pricingGitHub Advanced SecuritySecurity that moves at the  speed of developmentRequest a demoSee plans & pricingStop leaks before  they startExplore Secret ProtectionFix vulnerabilities  in your codeExplore Code SecurityGitHub is used byPauseBecome a risk reduction warriorStay ahead of threats with built-in security, secret protection, and dependency monitoring.Strengthen your development with AIWrite secure code at scale with AI-driven insights and automated fixes from GitHub Copilot Autofix.Empower your team with native AppSecFind and fix vulnerabilities in real time by integrating application security right into GitHub.“GitHub Advanced Security has solved the risk of leaked credentials.

GHAS adds cutting-edge tools for static analysis, software composition analysis, and secret scanning to the GitHub platform that developers already know and love. Unlike traditional application security packages that burden the software development toolchain with complex workflows that inhibit adoption, GHAS makes it easy for developers to find and fix vulnerabilities earlier in the software development life cycle. Why choose GitHub Advanced Security instead of a third-party AppSec product?Unlike third-party security add-ons, GitHub Advanced Security operates entirely in the native GitHub workflows that developers already know and love. By making it easier for developers to remediate vulnerabilities as they go, GitHub Advanced Security frees time for security teams to focus on critical strategies that protect businesses, customers, and communities from application-based vulnerabilities.What is DevSecOps?DevSecOps refers to a combination of the development, security, and operations tools necessary to develop software applications.What is AppSec?Application security (AppSec) is the process of finding, fixing, and preventing security vulnerabilities in applications. GitHub Advanced Security provides AppSec tools for static application security testing (SAST), which identifies vulnerabilities in the code itself.

“The new planning and tracking functionality keeps my project management close to my code. I no longer find myself needing to reach for spreadsheets or 3P tools which go stale instantly.Dan GodfreyDevelopment ManagerFlexible project planning for developers Start using projectsContact salesFrequently asked questionsWhat is GitHub Issues?We all need a way to plan our work, track issues, and discuss the things we build. Our answer to this universal question is GitHub Issues, and it’s built-in to every repository. GitHub’s issue tracking is unique because of our focus on simplicity, references, and elegant formatting.With GitHub Issues, you can express ideas with GitHub Flavored Markdown, assign and mention contributors, react with emojis, clarify with attachments and videos, plus reference code like commits, pull requests, and deploys. With task lists, you can break big issues into tasks, further organize your work with milestones and labels, and track relationships and dependencies.We built GitHub Issues for developers. It is simple, adaptable, and powerful.What are Projects?As teams and projects grow, how we work evolves. Tools that hard-code a methodology are too specific and rigid to adapt to any moment. Often, we find ourselves creating a spreadsheet or pulling out a notepad to have the space to think. Then our planning is disconnected from where the work happens.The new Projects connect your planning directly to the work your teams are doing and flexibly adapt to whatever your team needs at any point. Built like a spreadsheet, project tables give you a live canvas to filter, sort, and group issues and pull requests. You can use it, or the accompanying project board, along with custom fields, to track a sprint, plan a feature, or manage a large-scale release.What plans have access to Projects?All users have access to the free tier of GitHub Issues and Projects. For more information about paid tiers, see our pricing page.Will the new Projects experience be available in GitHub Enterprise Server?Yes!

          One of the big benefits of using GitHub for CI/CD and security automation is that we don’t have to build, deploy, or maintain additional tools because they’re built-in to GitHub. That means developers can spend less time managing tools and more time writing code, which is how they’d prefer to spend their time.

            About The ReadME Project
            Coding is usually seen as a solitary activity, but it’s actually the world’s largest community effort led by open source maintainers, contributors, and teams. These unsung heroes put in long hours to build software, fix issues, field questions, and manage communities.
            The ReadME Project is part of GitHub’s ongoing effort to amplify the voices of the developer community. It’s an evolving space to engage with the community and explore the stories, challenges, technology, and culture that surround the world of open source.

GitHub Copilot functionality works in code editors regardless of code hosting platform. Some features are enhanced with the use of GitHub because Copilot can directly draw context and knowledge from repositories, pull requests, issues, and other data structures in the GitHub platform.
Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models. 
Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations. With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a Data Protection Agreement that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.\n\n\n\nEnterprise

          “
          Our support engineer was very helpful in pointing me to the exact resource I needed in minutes.

          The support agent took care of the request with a great sense of urgency and addressed the issue well.
          
            
          
        
        
          “
          I'd like to applaud our engineer for how he exceptionally responded to our query. This ticket was not a simple, one-answer investigation and I was very happy with how he explored multiple angles to investigate.
          
            
          
        
        
          “
          Our engineer was super helpful and spot on with figuring out the problem. The steps he suggested helped me figure out the problem quickly. Kudos!

          Choosing your plan


    
  
    
      
      
        What is escalation and incident management?
      
    
    
      Escalation and incident management is the ability to escalate ticket progression in the GitHub support portal. After someone escalates a ticket, Support Incident Coordinators orchestrate all necessary parties to resolve the ticket. Additionally, Senior Escalation Engineers (SEEs) facilitate GitHub-internal technical communications and liaise with the rest of GitHub to improve the support team’s capability in similar future circumstances.
      
    
  


    
  
    
      
      
        What is incident response management?
      
    
    
      Incident response management helps manage the technical resources needed for case resolution. Support Incident Coordinators are available for incident response management 24/7.
      
    
  


    
  
    
      
      
        What are my SLAs for initial response?
      
    
    
      GitHub Premium Support and GitHub Premium Plus Support customers have SLAs. For urgent priority tickets, your SLA guarantees a 30-minute initial response time, which includes troubleshooting. For high priority tickets, your SLA provides a four-hour initial response time.
      
    
  


    
  
    
      
      
        What’s included in initial troubleshooting?
      
    
    
      For initial troubleshooting, the assigned Premium Support Engineer/Customer Reliability Engineer will review and acknowledge your ticket. To better understand the issue and start troubleshooting, the engineer may ask for additional information such as screenshots, error messages, log files, diagnostics files, support bundles, or the output of specific console commands. They may also collaborate with others in support, engineering, or in the regional incident commander.
If a callback was requested, the engineer will determine if screen sharing is the most effective way to drive ticket resolution. If so, they will invite you to join a screen-sharing session.
      
    
  


    
  
    
      
      
        How do I get health check reports?
      
    
    
      GitHub Premium Support and GitHub Premium Plus Support customers are entitled to unlimited automated health check reports. Additionally, GitHub Premium Plus Support customers can request quarterly enhanced health checks with findings, interpretations, and recommendations from a Customer Reliability Engineer (CRE).
      
    
  


    
  
    
      
      
        What is crisis prevention?
      
    
    
      Crisis prevention allows GitHub Enterprise Server customers to prepare for — and experience — an incident without risk. Your Customer Reliability Engineer (CRE) guides your team through an incident simulation in a safe and controlled environment.
Crisis Prevention consists of up to four sessions about reliability best practices, preparing for a potential incident, and efficiently interacting with GitHub Support. After the incident simulation, your CRE will run a detailed retrospective, uncovering lessons learned and improvement suggestions for the future.
      
    
  


    
  
    
      
      
        How long does GitHub Premium Support take?
      
    
    
      GitHub Premium Support and GitHub Premium Plus Support Plus customers have service-level agreements (SLAs) for initial response. For urgent priority tickets, the initial response SLA guarantees a 30-minute initial response time, which includes troubleshooting. For high-priority tickets, the initial response SLA provides a four-hour time.
We currently do not provide estimates for time to resolution, as the complexity of tickets varies. However, we review these metrics on a regular basis and reduce times whenever possible.
      
    
  


    
  
    
      
      
        How do I resolve a problem in GitHub Enterprise?
      
    
    
      You can get support via online ticket submission if you’re using the basic plan included with your GitHub Enterprise license. If you have GitHub Premium Support or GitHub Premium Plus Support, you can submit a ticket online. For urgent tickets, GitHub Premium Support and GitHub Premium Plus Support customers can request a callback and have a screen-sharing session with one of our Premium Support Engineers or Customer Reliability Engineers (CREs). Please refer to our plan comparison table for more details.
      
    
  



          Rules and policies


    
  
    
      
      
        If I do not use all the technical advisory hours in a given quarter, can they be carried over?
      
    
    
      Premium Plus customers may use up to 12 technical advisory hours per quarter. Unused technical advisory hours may not be carried over into the next quarter.
      
    
  


    
  
    
      
      
        How can the technical advisory support hours be used? 
      
    
    
      There are multiple ways you can use technical advisory hours, including but not limited to:

Consultations regarding GitHub best practices and general recommendations
GitHub Enterprise Server upgrade preparation and assistance

      
    
  


    
  
    
      
      
        Does GitHub Premium Support provide service on weekends?
      
    
    
      Yes! GitHub Premium Support and GitHub Premium Plus Support customers receive 24/7 support.
      
    
  



          Upgrading your plan


    
  
    
      
      
        What virtual trainings are available with GitHub Premium Plus Support and who can participate?
      
    
    
      Customers get access to one virtual training class per year. Topics include:

GitHub for developers
GitHub for admins (Server)
GitHub for admins (Cloud)
GitHub for non-developers
GH API Training
GH Actions Fundamentals
GH Actions Intermediate
GH Copilot Fundamentals
GH Copilot Intermediate
GH Copilot Administration & Security
GitHub Enterprise Implementation (Cloud)

We recommend limiting training sessions to a maximum of 16 participants to ensure an optimal provider-to-participant ratio and a high-quality delivery experience. However, in specific cases where it makes sense, we can accommodate up to 20–25 participants while maintaining our commitment to delivering a valuable training experience for your team.
      
    
  


    
  
    
      
      
        What value will I get by upgrading to GitHub Premium Plus Support?
      
    
    
      GitHub Premium Plus Support customers get an assigned Customer Reliability Engineer (CRE), quarterly enhanced health checks, access to crisis prevention, technical advisory hours, and many additional benefits, which you can review in our plan comparison table.
      
    
  


    
  
    
      
      
        What’s the benefit of having a Customer Reliability Engineer (CRE) over a Premium Support Engineer?
      
    
    
      A CRE knows your customer account in detail and can help you expedite case resolution faster than a Premium Support Engineer.
      
    
  


    
  
    
      
      
        Since I get GitHub Enterprise Support for free, why should I upgrade to GitHub Premium Support?
      
    
    
      Most customers upgrade to GitHub Premium Support because they need initial response SLAs for urgent and high priority requests, phone support, screen share support for critical issues, and health checks.
