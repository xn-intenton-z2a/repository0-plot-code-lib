RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


1.  Introduction

   The comma separated values format (CSV) has been used for exchanging
   and converting data between various spreadsheet programs for quite
   some time.  Surprisingly, while this format is very common, it has
   never been formally documented.  Additionally, while the IANA MIME
   registration tree includes a registration for
   "text/tab-separated-values" type, no MIME types have ever been
   registered with IANA for CSV.  At the same time, various programs and
   operating systems have begun to use different MIME types for this
   format.  This RFC documents the format of comma separated values
   (CSV) files and formally registers the "text/csv" MIME type for CSV
   in accordance with RFC 2048 [1].

2.  Definition of the CSV Format

   While there are various specifications and implementations for the
   CSV format (for ex. [4], [5], [6] and [7]), there is no formal
   specification in existence, which allows for a wide variety of
   interpretations of CSV files.  This section documents the format that
   seems to be followed by most implementations:

   1.  Each record is located on a separate line, delimited by a line
       break (CRLF).  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF

   2.  The last record in the file may or may not have an ending line
       break.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   3.  There maybe an optional header line appearing as the first line
       of the file with the same format as normal record lines.  This
       header will contain names corresponding to the fields in the file
       and should contain the same number of fields as the records in
       the rest of the file (the presence or absence of the header line
       should be indicated via the optional "header" parameter of this
       MIME type).  For example:

       field_name,field_name,field_name CRLF
       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


   4.  Within the header and each record, there may be one or more
       fields, separated by commas.  Each line should contain the same
       number of fields throughout the file.  Spaces are considered part
       of a field and should not be ignored.  The last field in the
       record must not be followed by a comma.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc

   5.  Each field may or may not be enclosed in double quotes (however
       some programs, such as Microsoft Excel, do not use double quotes
       at all).  If fields are not enclosed with double quotes, then
       double quotes may not appear inside the fields.  For example:

       "aaa","bbb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   6.  Fields containing line breaks (CRLF), double quotes, and commas
       should be enclosed in double-quotes.  For example:

       "aaa","b CRLF
       bb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   7.  If double-quotes are used to enclose fields, then a double-quote
       appearing inside a field must be escaped by preceding it with
       another double quote.  For example:

       "aaa","b""bb","ccc"

   The ABNF grammar [2] appears as follows:

   file = [header CRLF] record *(CRLF record) [CRLF]

   header = name *(COMMA name)

   record = field *(COMMA field)

   name = field

   field = (escaped / non-escaped)

   escaped = DQUOTE *(TEXTDATA / COMMA / CR / LF / 2DQUOTE) DQUOTE

   non-escaped = *TEXTDATA

   COMMA = %x2C

   CR = %x0D ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


   DQUOTE =  %x22 ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   LF = %x0A ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   CRLF = CR LF ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   TEXTDATA =  %x20-21 / %x23-2B / %x2D-7E

3.  MIME Type Registration of text/csv

   This section provides the media-type registration application (as per
   RFC 2048 [1].

   To: ietf-types@iana.org

   Subject: Registration of MIME media type text/csv

   MIME media type name: text

   MIME subtype name: csv

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: charset, header

      Common usage of CSV is US-ASCII, but other character sets defined
      by IANA for the "text" tree may be used in conjunction with the
      "charset" parameter.

      The "header" parameter indicates the presence or absence of the
      header line.  Valid values are "present" or "absent".
      Implementors choosing not to use this parameter must make their
      own decisions as to whether the header line is present or absent.

   Encoding considerations:

      As per section 4.1.1. of RFC 2046 [3], this media type uses CRLF
      to denote line breaks.  However, implementors should be aware that
      some implementations may use other values.

   Security considerations:

      CSV files contain passive text data that should not pose any
      risks.  However, it is possible in theory that malicious binary
      data may be included in order to exploit potential buffer overruns
      in the program processing CSV data.  Additionally, private data
      may be shared via this format (which of course applies to any text
      data).

   Interoperability considerations:

      Due to lack of a single specification, there are considerable
      differences among implementations.  Implementors should "be
      conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from
      others" (RFC 793 [8]) when processing CSV files.  An attempt at a
      common definition can be found in Section 2.

      Implementations deciding not to use the optional "header"
      parameter must make their own decision as to whether the header is
      absent or present.

   Published specification:

      While numerous private specifications exist for various programs
      and systems, there is no single "master" specification for this
      format.  An attempt at a common definition can be found in Section
      2.

   Applications that use this media type:

      Spreadsheet programs and various data conversion utilities

   Additional information:

      Magic number(s): none

      File extension(s): CSV

      Macintosh File Type Code(s): TEXT

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005

1.  Introduction

   The comma separated values format (CSV) has been used for exchanging
   and converting data between various spreadsheet programs for quite
   some time.  Surprisingly, while this format is very common, it has
   never been formally documented.  Additionally, while the IANA MIME
   registration tree includes a registration for
   "text/tab-separated-values" type, no MIME types have ever been
   registered with IANA for CSV.  At the same time, various programs and
   operating systems have begun to use different MIME types for this
   format.  This RFC documents the format of comma separated values
   (CSV) files and formally registers the "text/csv" MIME type for CSV
   in accordance with RFC 2048 [1].

2.  Definition of the CSV Format

   While there are various specifications and implementations for the
   CSV format (for ex. [4], [5], [6] and [7]), there is no formal
   specification in existence, which allows for a wide variety of
   interpretations of CSV files.  This section documents the format that
   seems to be followed by most implementations:

   1.  Each record is located on a separate line, delimited by a line
       break (CRLF).  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF

   2.  The last record in the file may or may not have an ending line
       break.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   3.  There maybe an optional header line appearing as the first line
       of the file with the same format as normal record lines.  This
       header will contain names corresponding to the fields in the file
       and should contain the same number of fields as the records in
       the rest of the file (the presence or absence of the header line
       should be indicated via the optional "header" parameter of this
       MIME type).  For example:

       field_name,field_name,field_name CRLF
       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF

Shafranovich                 Informational                      [Page 2]
RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005

   4.  Within the header and each record, there may be one or more
       fields, separated by commas.  Each line should contain the same
       number of fields throughout the file.  Spaces are considered part
       of a field and should not be ignored.  The last field in the
       record must not be followed by a comma.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc

   5.  Each field may or may not be enclosed in double quotes (however
       some programs, such as Microsoft Excel, do not use double quotes
       at all).  If fields are not enclosed with double quotes, then
       double quotes may not appear inside the fields.  For example:

       "aaa","bbb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   6.  Fields containing line breaks (CRLF), double quotes, and commas
       should be enclosed in double-quotes.  For example:

       "aaa","b CRLF
       bb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   7.  If double-quotes are used to enclose fields, then a double-quote
       appearing inside a field must be escaped by preceding it with
       another double quote.  For example:

       "aaa","b""bb","ccc"

   The ABNF grammar [2] appears as follows:

   file = [header CRLF] record *(CRLF record) [CRLF]

   header = name *(COMMA name)

   record = field *(COMMA field)

   name = field

   field = (escaped / non-escaped)

   escaped = DQUOTE *(TEXTDATA / COMMA / CR / LF / 2DQUOTE) DQUOTE

   non-escaped = *TEXTDATA

   COMMA = %x2C

   CR = %x0D ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005

   DQUOTE =  %x22 ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   LF = %x0A ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   CRLF = CR LF ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   TEXTDATA =  %x20-21 / %x23-2B / %x2D-7E

3.  MIME Type Registration of text/csv

   This section provides the media-type registration application (as per
   RFC 2048 [1].

   To: ietf-types@iana.org

   Subject: Registration of MIME media type text/csv

   MIME media type name: text

   MIME subtype name: csv

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: charset, header

      Common usage of CSV is US-ASCII, but other character sets defined
      by IANA for the "text" tree may be used in conjunction with the
      "charset" parameter.

      The "header" parameter indicates the presence or absence of the
      header line.  Valid values are "present" or "absent".
      Implementors choosing not to use this parameter must make their
      own decisions as to whether the header line is present or absent.

   Encoding considerations:

      As per section 4.1.1. of RFC 2046 [3], this media type uses CRLF
      to denote line breaks.  However, implementors should be aware that
      some implementations may use other values.

   Security considerations:

      CSV files contain passive text data that should not pose any
      risks.  However, it is possible in theory that malicious binary
      data may be included in order to exploit potential buffer overruns
      in the program processing CSV data.  Additionally, private data
      may be shared via this format (which of course applies to any text
      data).

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005

   Interoperability considerations:

      Due to lack of a single specification, there are considerable
      differences among implementations.  Implementors should "be
      conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from
      others" (RFC 793 [8]) when processing CSV files.  An attempt at a
      common definition can be found in Section 2.

      Implementations deciding not to use the optional "header"
      parameter must make their own decision as to whether the header is
      absent or present.

   Published specification:

      While numerous private specifications exist for various programs
      and systems, there is no single "master" specification for this
      format.  An attempt at a common definition can be found in Section
      2.

   Applications that use this media type:

      Spreadsheet programs and various data conversion utilities

   Additional information:

      Magic number(s): none

      File extension(s): CSV

      Macintosh File Type Code(s): TEXT

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005

1.  Introduction

   The comma separated values format (CSV) has been used for exchanging
   and converting data between various spreadsheet programs for quite
   some time.  Surprisingly, while this format is very common, it has
   never been formally documented.  Additionally, while the IANA MIME
   registration tree includes a registration for
   "text/tab-separated-values" type, no MIME types have ever been
   registered with IANA for CSV.  At the same time, various programs and
   operating systems have begun to use different MIME types for this
   format.  This RFC documents the format of comma separated values
   (CSV) files and formally registers the "text/csv" MIME type for CSV
   in accordance with RFC 2048 [1].

2.  Definition of the CSV Format

   While there are various specifications and implementations for the
   CSV format (for ex. [4], [5], [6] and [7]), there is no formal
   specification in existence, which allows for a wide variety of
   interpretations of CSV files.  This section documents the format that
   seems to be followed by most implementations:

   1.  Each record is located on a separate line, delimited by a line
       break (CRLF).  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF

   2.  The last record in the file may or may not have an ending line
       break.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   3.  There maybe an optional header line appearing as the first line
       of the file with the same format as normal record lines.  This
       header will contain names corresponding to the fields in the file
       and should contain the same number of fields as the records in
       the rest of the file (the presence or absence of the header line
       should be indicated via the optional "header" parameter of this
       MIME type).  For example:

       field_name,field_name,field_name CRLF
       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF

Shafranovich                 Informational                      [Page 2]
RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005

   4.  Within the header and each record, there may be one or more
       fields, separated by commas.  Each line should contain the same
       number of fields throughout the file.  Spaces are considered part
       of a field and should not be ignored.  The last field in the
       record must not be followed by a comma.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc

   5.  Each field may or may not be enclosed in double quotes (however
       some programs, such as Microsoft Excel, do not use double quotes
       at all).  If fields are not enclosed with double quotes, then
       double quotes may not appear inside the fields.  For example:

       "aaa","bbb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   6.  Fields containing line breaks (CRLF), double quotes, and commas
       should be enclosed in double-quotes.  For example:

       "aaa","b CRLF
       bb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   7.  If double-quotes are used to enclose fields, then a double-quote
       appearing inside a field must be escaped by preceding it with
       another double quote.  For example:

       "aaa","b""bb","ccc"

   The ABNF grammar [2] appears as follows:

   file = [header CRLF] record *(CRLF record) [CRLF]

   header = name *(COMMA name)

   record = field *(COMMA field)

   name = field

   field = (escaped / non-escaped)

   escaped = DQUOTE *(TEXTDATA / COMMA / CR / LF / 2DQUOTE) DQUOTE

   non-escaped = *TEXTDATA

   COMMA = %x2C

   CR = %x0D ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005

   DQUOTE =  %x22 ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   LF = %x0A ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   CRLF = CR LF ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   TEXTDATA =  %x20-21 / %x23-2B / %x2D-7E

3.  MIME Type Registration of text/csv

   This section provides the media-type registration application (as per
   RFC 2048 [1].

   To: ietf-types@iana.org

   Subject: Registration of MIME media type text/csv

   MIME media type name: text

   MIME subtype name: csv

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: charset, header

      Common usage of CSV is US-ASCII, but other character sets defined
      by IANA for the "text" tree may be used in conjunction with the
      "charset" parameter.

      The "header" parameter indicates the presence or absence of the
      header line.  Valid values are "present" or "absent".
      Implementors choosing not to use this parameter must make their
      own decisions as to whether the header line is present or absent.

   Encoding considerations:

      As per section 4.1.1. of RFC 2046 [3], this media type uses CRLF
      to denote line breaks.  However, implementors should be aware that
      some implementations may use other values.

   Security considerations:

      CSV files contain passive text data that should not pose any
      risks.  However, it is possible in theory that malicious binary
      data may be included in order to exploit potential buffer overruns
      in the program processing CSV data.  Additionally, private data
      may be shared via this format (which of course applies to any text
      data).

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005

   Interoperability considerations:

      Due to lack of a single specification, there are considerable
      differences among implementations.  Implementors should "be
      conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from
      others" (RFC 793 [8]) when processing CSV files.  An attempt at a
      common definition can be found in Section 2.

      Implementations deciding not to use the optional "header"
      parameter must make their own decision as to whether the header is
      absent or present.

   Published specification:

      While numerous private specifications exist for various programs
      and systems, there is no single "master" specification for this
      format.  An attempt at a common definition can be found in Section
      2.

   Applications that use this media type:

      Spreadsheet programs and various data conversion utilities

   Additional information:

      Magic number(s): none

      File extension(s): CSV

      Macintosh File Type Code(s): TEXT

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005

1.  Introduction

   The comma separated values format (CSV) has been used for exchanging
   and converting data between various spreadsheet programs for quite
   some time.  Surprisingly, while this format is very common, it has
   never been formally documented.  Additionally, while the IANA MIME
   registration tree includes a registration for
   "text/tab-separated-values" type, no MIME types have ever been
   registered with IANA for CSV.  At the same time, various programs and
   operating systems have begun to use different MIME types for this
   format.  This RFC documents the format of comma separated values
   (CSV) files and formally registers the "text/csv" MIME type for CSV
   in accordance with RFC 2048 [1].

2.  Definition of the CSV Format

   While there are various specifications and implementations for the
   CSV format (for ex. [4], [5], [6] and [7]), there is no formal
   specification in existence, which allows for a wide variety of
   interpretations of CSV files.  This section documents the format that
   seems to be followed by most implementations:

   1.  Each record is located on a separate line, delimited by a line
       break (CRLF).  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF

   2.  The last record in the file may or may not have an ending line
       break.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   3.  There maybe an optional header line appearing as the first line
       of the file with the same format as normal record lines.  This
       header will contain names corresponding to the fields in the file
       and should contain the same number of fields as the records in
       the rest of the file (the presence or absence of the header line
       should be indicated via the optional "header" parameter of this
       MIME type).  For example:

       field_name,field_name,field_name CRLF
       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF

Shafranovich                 Informational                      [Page 2]
RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005

   4.  Within the header and each record, there may be one or more
       fields, separated by commas.  Each line should contain the same
       number of fields throughout the file.  Spaces are considered part
       of a field and should not be ignored.  The last field in the
       record must not be followed by a comma.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc

   5.  Each field may or may not be enclosed in double quotes (however
       some programs, such as Microsoft Excel, do not use double quotes
       at all).  If fields are not enclosed with double quotes, then
       double quotes may not appear inside the fields.  For example:

       "aaa","bbb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   6.  Fields containing line breaks (CRLF), double quotes, and commas
       should be enclosed in double-quotes.  For example:

       "aaa","b CRLF
       bb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   7.  If double-quotes are used to enclose fields, then a double-quote
       appearing inside a field must be escaped by preceding it with
       another double quote.  For example:

       "aaa","b""bb","ccc"

   The ABNF grammar [2] appears as follows:

   file = [header CRLF] record *(CRLF record) [CRLF]

   header = name *(COMMA name)

   record = field *(COMMA field)

   name = field

   field = (escaped / non-escaped)

   escaped = DQUOTE *(TEXTDATA / COMMA / CR / LF / 2DQUOTE) DQUOTE

   non-escaped = *TEXTDATA

   COMMA = %x2C

   CR = %x0D ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005

   DQUOTE =  %x22 ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   LF = %x0A ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   CRLF = CR LF ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   TEXTDATA =  %x20-21 / %x23-2B / %x2D-7E

3.  MIME Type Registration of text/csv

   This section provides the media-type registration application (as per
   RFC 2048 [1].

   To: ietf-types@iana.org

   Subject: Registration of MIME media type text/csv

   MIME media type name: text

   MIME subtype name: csv

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: charset, header

      Common usage of CSV is US-ASCII, but other character sets defined
      by IANA for the "text" tree may be used in conjunction with the
      "charset" parameter.

      The "header" parameter indicates the presence or absence of the
      header line.  Valid values are "present" or "absent".
      Implementors choosing not to use this parameter must make their
      own decisions as to whether the header line is present or absent.

   Encoding considerations:

      As per section 4.1.1. of RFC 2046 [3], this media type uses CRLF
      to denote line breaks.  However, implementors should be aware that
      some implementations may use other values.

   Security considerations:

      CSV files contain passive text data that should not pose any
      risks.  However, it is possible in theory that malicious binary
      data may be included in order to exploit potential buffer overruns
      in the program processing CSV data.  Additionally, private data
      may be shared via this format (which of course applies to any text
      data).

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005

   Interoperability considerations:

      Due to lack of a single specification, there are considerable
      differences among implementations.  Implementors should "be
      conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from
      others" (RFC 793 [8]) when processing CSV files.  An attempt at a
      common definition can be found in Section 2.

      Implementations deciding not to use the optional "header"
      parameter must make their own decision as to whether the header is
      absent or present.

   Published specification:

      While numerous private specifications exist for various programs
      and systems, there is no single "master" specification for this
      format.  An attempt at a common definition can be found in Section
      2.

   Applications that use this media type:

      Spreadsheet programs and various data conversion utilities

   Additional information:

      Magic number(s): none

      File extension(s): CSV

      Macintosh File Type Code(s): TEXT

RFC 7111              text/csv Fragment Identifiers         January 2014


1.  Introduction

   This memo updates the text/csv media type defined in RFC 4180
   [RFC4180] by defining URI fragment identifiers for text/csv MIME
   entities.

   The change to the text/csv media type registration required IESG
   approval, as the IESG is the change controller for that registration.
   The IESG has, after consultation with the IETF community, approved
   the change, which is specified in Section 5 of this document.

   This section gives an introduction to the general concepts of
   text/csv MIME entities and URI fragment identifiers and discusses the
   need for fragment identifiers for text/csv and deployment issues.
   Section 2 discusses the principles and methods on which this memo is
   based.  Section 3 defines the syntax, and Section 4 discusses
   processing of text/csv fragment identifiers.

1.1.  What is text/csv?

   Internet Media Types (often referred to as "MIME types") as defined
   in RFC 2045 [RFC2045] and RFC 2046 [RFC2046] are used to identify
   different types and subtypes of media.  The text/csv media type is
   defined in RFC 4180 [RFC4180], using US-ASCII [ASCII] as the default
   character encoding (other character encodings can be used as well).
   Apart from a media type parameter for specifying the character
   encoding ("charset"), there is a second media type parameter
   ("header") that indicates whether there is a header row in the CSV
   document or not.

1.2.  Why text/csv Fragment Identifiers?

   URIs are the identification mechanism for resources on the Web.  The
   URI syntax specified in RFC 3986 [RFC3986] optionally includes a so-
   called "fragment identifier", separated by a number sign ("#").  The
   fragment identifier consists of additional reference information to
   be interpreted by the client after the retrieval action has been
   successfully completed.  The semantics of a fragment identifier is a
   property of the media type resulting from a retrieval action,
   regardless of the URI scheme used in the URI reference.  Therefore,
   the format and interpretation of fragment identifiers is dependent on
   the media type of the retrieval result.

1.2.1.  Motivation

   Similar to the motivation in RFC 5147 [RFC5147], which defines
   fragment identifiers for plain text files, referring to specific
   parts of a resource can be very useful because it enables users and



Hausenblas, et al.            Informational                     [Page 3]

RFC 7111              text/csv Fragment Identifiers         January 2014


   applications to create more specific references.  Users can create
   references to a particular point of interest within a resource,
   rather than referring to the complete resource.  Even though it is
   suggested that fragment identification methods are specified in a
   media type's registration (see [RFC6838]), many media types do not
   have fragment identification methods associated with them.

   Fragment identifiers are only useful if supported by the client,
   because they are only interpreted by the client.  Therefore, a new
   fragment identification method will require some time to be adopted
   by clients, and older clients will not support it.  However, because
   the URI still works even if the fragment identifier is not supported
   (the resource is retrieved, but the fragment identifier is not
   interpreted), rapid adoption is not highly critical to ensure the
   success of a new fragment identification method.

1.2.2.  Use Cases

   Fragment identifiers for text/csv as defined in this memo make it
   possible to refer to specific parts of a text/csv MIME entity.  Use
   cases include, but are not limited to, selecting a part for visual
   rendering, stream processing, making assertions about a certain value
   (provenance, confidence, comments, etc.), or data integration.

1.3.  Incremental Deployment

   As long as text/csv fragment identifiers are not supported
   universally, it is important to consider the implications of
   incremental deployment.  Clients (for example, Web browsers) not
   supporting the text/csv fragment identifier described in this memo
   will work with URI references to text/csv MIME entities, but they
   will fail to understand the identification of the sub-resource
   specified by the fragment identifier, and thus will behave as if the
   complete resource was referenced.  This is a reasonable fallback
   behavior and, in general users, should take into account the
   possibility that a program interpreting a given URI will fail to
   interpret the fragment identifier part.  Since fragment identifier
   evaluation is local to the client (and happens after retrieving the
   MIME entity), there is no reliable way for a server to determine
   whether a requesting client is using a URI containing a fragment
   identifier.

1.4.  Notation Used in this Memo

   The capitalized key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
   "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Fragment Identification Methods

   This memo specifies fragment identification using the following
   methods: "row" for row selections, "col" for columns selections, and
   "cell" for cell selections.

   Throughout the sections below, the following example table in CSV
   (having 7 rows, including one header row, and 3 columns) is used:

   date,temperature,place
   2011-01-01,1,Galway
   2011-01-02,-1,Galway
   2011-01-03,0,Galway
   2011-01-01,6,Berkeley
   2011-01-02,8,Berkeley
   2011-01-03,5,Berkeley

2.1.  Row-Based Selection

   To select a specific record, the "row" scheme followed by a single
   number is used (the first row is at position 1).

   http://example.com/data.csv#row=4

   The above CSV fragment identifies the fourth row:

   2011-01-03,0,Galway

   Fragments can also select ranges of rows:

   http://example.com/data.csv#row=5-7

   The above CSV fragment identifies three consecutive rows:

   2011-01-01,6,Berkeley
   2011-01-02,8,Berkeley
   2011-01-03,5,Berkeley

   The value "*" can be used to indicate the last row, so the previous
   URI is equivalent to:

   http://example.com/data.csv#row=5-*

2.2.  Column-Based Selection

   To select values from a certain column, the "col" scheme is used,
   followed by a position (the first column is at position 1):

   http://example.com/data.csv#col=2

   The above CSV fragment addresses the second column, identifying the
   column:

   temperature
   1
   -1
   0
   6
   8
   5

   The "col" scheme can also be used to identify ranges of columns:

   http://example.com/data.csv#col=1-2

   The above CSV fragment addresses the first and second column:

   date,temperature
   2011-01-01,1
   2011-01-02,-1
   2011-01-03,0
   2011-01-01,6
   2011-01-02,8
   2011-01-03,5

   As for rows, the value "*" can be used to indicate the last column.

2.3.  Cell-Based Selection

   To select particular fields, the "cell" scheme is used, followed by a
   row number, a comma, and a column number.

   http://example.com/data.csv#cell=4,1

   The above CSV fragment addresses the field in the first column within
   the fourth row, yielding:

   2011-01-03






Hausenblas, et al.            Informational                     [Page 6]

RFC 7111              text/csv Fragment Identifiers         January 2014


   It is also possible to select cell-based fragments that have more
   than just one cell, in which case the cell selection uses the same
   range syntax as for row and column range selections.  For these
   selections, the syntax uses the upper left-hand cell as the starting
   point of the selection, followed by a minus sign, and then the lower
   right-hand cell as the end point of the selection.

   http://example.com/data.csv#cell=4,1-6,2

   The above CSV fragment selects a region that starts at the fourth row
   and the first column and ends at the sixth row and the second column:

   2011-01-03,0
   2011-01-01,6
   2011-01-02,8

2.4.  Multi-Selections

   Row, column, and cell selections can make more than one selection, in
   which case the individual selections are separated by semicolons.  In
   these cases, the resulting fragment may be a disjoint fragment, such
   as the selection "#row=3;6" for the example CSV, which would select
   the third and the sixth row.  It is up to the user agent to decide
   how to handle disjoint fragments, but since they are allowed, user
   agents should be prepared to handle disjoint fragments.

3.  Fragment Identification Syntax

   The syntax for the text/csv fragment identifiers is as follows.

   The following syntax definition uses ABNF as defined in RFC 5234
   [RFC5234], including the rule DIGIT.

   NOTE:  In the descriptions that follow, specified text values MUST be
      used exactly as given, using exactly the indicated lowercase
      letters.  In this respect, the ABNF usage differs from [RFC5234].

   csv-fragment =  rowsel / colsel / cellsel
   rowsel       =  "row=" singlespec 0*( ";" singlespec)
   colsel       =  "col=" singlespec 0*( ";" singlespec)
   cellsel      =  "cell=" cellspec 0*( ";" cellspec)
   singlespec   =  position [ "-" position ]
   cellspec     =  cellrow "," cellcol [ "-" cellrow "," cellcol ]
   cellrow      =  position
   cellcol      =  position
   position     =  number / "*"
   number       =  1*( DIGIT )

RFC 7111              text/csv Fragment Identifiers         January 2014


4.  Fragment Identifier Processing

   Applications implementing support for the mechanism described in this
   memo MUST behave as described in the following sections.

4.1.  Syntax Errors in Fragment Identifiers

   If a fragment identifier contains a syntax error (i.e., does not
   conform to the syntax specified in Section 3), then it MUST be
   ignored by clients.  Clients MUST NOT make any attempt to correct or
   guess fragment identifiers.  Syntax errors MAY be reported by
   clients.

4.2.  Semantics of Fragment Identifiers

   Rows and columns in CSV are counted from one.  Positions thus refer
   to the rows and columns starting from position 1, which identifies
   the first row or column of a CSV.  The special character "*" can be
   used to refer to the last row or column of a CSV, thus allowing
   fragment identifiers to easily identify ranges that extend to the
   last row or column.

   If single selections refer to non-existing rows or columns (i.e.,
   beyond the size of the CSV), they MUST be ignored.

   If ranges extend beyond the size of the CSV (by extending to rows or
   columns beyond the size of the CSV), they MUST be interpreted to only
   extend to the actual size of the CSV.

   If selections of ranges of rows, ranges of columns, or ranges of
   cells are specified in a way so that they select "inversely" (i.e.,
   "#row=10-5" or "#cell=10,10-5,5"), they MUST be ignored.

   Each specification of an identified region is processed
   independently, and ignored specifications (because of reasons listed
   in the previous paragraphs) do not cause the whole fragment
   identifier to fail, they just mean that this single specification is
   ignored.  For the example file, the fragment identifier
   "#row=1-2;5-4;13-16" does identify the first two rows: the second
   specification is an "inverse" specification and thus is ignored, and
   the third specification targets rows beyond the actual size of the
   CSV and thus is also ignored.

   The complete fragment identifier identifies all the successfully
   evaluated identified parts as a single identified fragment.  This
   fragment can be disjoint because of multiple selections.  Multiple
   selections also can result in overlapping individual parts, and it is
   up to the user agent how to process such a fragment and whether the



Hausenblas, et al.            Informational                     [Page 8]

RFC 7111              text/csv Fragment Identifiers         January 2014


   individual parts are still made accessible (i.e., visualized in
   visual user agents) or are presented as one unit.  For example, the
   fragment identifier "#row=3-6;4-5" contains a second identified part
   that is completely contained in the first identified part.  Whether a
   user agent maintains this selection as two parts, or simply signals
   that the identified fragment spans from the third to the sixth row,
   is up for the user agent to decide.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has added a reference to this specification in the text/csv
   media type registration.

5.1.  The text/csv media type

   The Internet media type [RFC6838] for a CSV document is text/csv.
   The following registration has been copied from the original
   registration of text/csv [RFC4180], with the exception of the added
   fragment identification considerations and added security
   considerations for fragment identifiers.

   Type name:  text

   Subtype name:  csv

   Required parameters:  none

   Optional parameters:  charset, header

      The "charset" parameter specifies the charset employed by the CSV
      content.  In accordance with RFC 6657 [RFC6657], the charset
      parameter SHOULD be used, and if it is not present, UTF-8 SHOULD
      be assumed as the default (this implies that US-ASCII CSV will
      work, even when not specifying the "charset" parameter).  Any
      charset defined by IANA for the "text" tree may be used in
      conjunction with the "charset" parameter.

      The "header" parameter indicates the presence or absence of the
      header line.  Valid values are "present" or "absent".
      Implementors choosing not to use this parameter must make their
      own decisions as to whether the header line is present or absent.

   Encoding considerations:  CSV MIME entities consist of binary data
      [RFC6838].  As per Section 4.1.1. of RFC 2046 [RFC2046], this
      media type uses CRLF to denote line breaks.  However, implementers
      should be aware that some implementations may use other values.





Hausenblas, et al.            Informational                     [Page 9]

RFC 7111              text/csv Fragment Identifiers         January 2014


   Security considerations:

      Text/csv consists of nothing but passive text data that should not
      pose any direct risks.  However, it is possible that malicious
      data may be included in order to exploit buffer overruns or other
      bugs in the program processing the text/csv data.

      The text/csv format provides no confidentiality or integrity
      protection, so if such protections are needed, they must be
      supplied externally.

      The fact that software implementing fragment identifiers for CSV
      and software not implementing them differs in behavior, and the
      fact that different software may show documents or fragments to
      users in different ways, can lead to misunderstandings on the part
      of users.  Such misunderstandings might be exploited in a way
      similar to spoofing or phishing.

      Implementers and users of fragment identifiers for CSV text should
      also be aware of the security considerations in RFC 3986 [RFC3986]
      and RFC 3987 [RFC3987].

   Interoperability considerations:  Due to lack of a single
      specification, there are considerable differences among
      implementations.  Implementers should "be conservative in what you
      do, be liberal in what you accept from others" (RFC 793 [RFC0793])
      when processing CSV files.  An attempt at a common definition can
      be found in Section 2.  Implementations deciding not to use the
      optional "header" parameter must make their own decision as to
      whether the header is absent or present.

   Published specification:  While numerous private specifications exist
      for various programs and systems, there is no single "master"
      specification for this format.  An attempt at a common definition
      can be found in Section 2 of RFC 4180 [RFC4180].

   Applications that use this media type:  Spreadsheet programs and
      various data conversion utilities.

   Fragment identifier considerations:  Fragment identification for
      text/csv is supported by using fragment identifiers as specified
      by RFC 7111.

Internet-Draft        Format and MIME Type for CSV            April 2005

1.  Introduction

   The comma separated values format (CSV) has been used for exchanging
   and converting data between various spreadsheet programs for quite
   some time.  Surprisingly, while this format is very common it has
   never been formally documented.  Additionally, while the IANA MIME
   registration tree includes a registration for "text/
   tab-separated-values" type, no MIME types have ever been registered
   with IANA for CSV.  At the same time, various programs and operating
   systems have begun to use different MIME types for this format, many
   of which vary from system to system.  This document seeks to document
   the format of comma separated values (CSV) files and to formally
   register the "text/csv" MIME type for CSV in accordance with RFC 2048
   [1].

2.  Definition of the CSV format

   While there are various specifications and implementations for the
   CSV format (for ex. [4], [5], [6] and [7]), no formal specification
   exists which causes a wide variety of interpretations for CSV files.
   This section seeks to document the format that seems to be followed
   by most implementations:

   1.  Each record is located on a separate line delimited by a line
       break (CRLF).  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF

   2.  The last record in the file may or may not have an ending line
       break.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   3.  There maybe an optional header line appearing as the first line
       of the file with the same format as normal record lines.  This
       header will contain names corresponding to the fields in the file
       and should contain the same number of fields as the records in
       the rest of the file (the presence or absence of the header line
       should be indicated via the optional "header" parameter of this
       MIME type).  For example:

       field_name,field_name,field_name CRLF
       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF

Internet-Draft        Format and MIME Type for CSV            April 2005

   4.  Within the header and each record there may be one or more
       fields, separated by commas.  Each line should contain the same
       number of fields throughout the file.  The last field in the
       record may not be followed by a comma.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc

   5.  Each field may or may not be enclosed in double quotes (however
       some programs such as Microsoft Excel do not use double quotes at
       all).  If fields are not enclosed with double quotes, then double
       quotes may not appear inside the fields.  For example:

       "aaa","bbb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   6.  Field containing line breaks (CRLF), double quotes and commas
       should be enclosed in double-quotes.  For example:

       "aaa","b CRLF
       bb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   7.  If double-quotes are used to enclosed fields, then a double-quote
       appearing inside a field must be escaped by preceding it with
       another double quote.  For example:

       "aaa","b""bb","ccc"

   The ABNF grammar [2] appears as follows:

      file = [header CRLF] record *(CRLF record) [CRLF]

      header = name *(COMMA name)

      record = field *(COMMA field)

      name = field

      field = (escaped / non-escaped)

      escaped = DQUOTE *(TEXTDATA / COMMA / CR / LF / 2DQUOTE) DQUOTE

      non-escaped = *TEXTDATA

      COMMA = %x2C

      CR = %x0D ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

      DQUOTE =  %x22 ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

      LF = %x0A ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

      CRLF = CR LF ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

      TEXTDATA =  %x20-21 / %x23-2B / %x2D-7E

3.  MIME Type Registration of text/csv

   This section provides the media-type registration application (as per
   RFC 2048 [1], which will be submitted to IANA after IESG approval of
   this document.

   To: ietf-types@iana.org

   Subject: Registration of MIME media type text/csv

   MIME media type name: text

   MIME subtype name: csv

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: charset, header

      Common usage of CSV is US-ASCII, but other character sets as
      defined by IANA for the "text" tree may be used in conjuction with
      the "charset" parameter.

      The "header" parameter indicates the presence or absence of the
      header line.  Valid values are "present" or "absent".
      Implementators choosing not to use this parameter must make their
      own decisions as to whether the header line is present or absent.

   Encoding considerations:

      As per section 4.1.1. of RFC 2046 [3], this media type uses CRLF
      to denote line breaks.  However, implementors should be aware that
      some implementations may use other values.

   Security considerations:

      CSV files contain passive text data which should not pose any
      risks.  However, it is possible in theory that malicious binary
      data maybe included in order to exploit potential buffer overruns
      in the program processing CSV data.  Additionally, private data

Internet-Draft        Format and MIME Type for CSV            April 2005

      maybe shared via this format (which of course applies to any text
      data).

   Interoperability considerations:

      Due to lack of a single specification there are considerable
      differences among different implementations.  Implementors should
      "be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept
      from others" (RFC 793 [8]) when processing CSV files.  An attempt
      at a common definition can be found in Section 2.

      Implementations deciding not to use the optional "header"
      parameter must make their own decision as to whether the header is
      absent or present.

   Published specification:

      While numerous private specifications exist for various programs
      and systems, there is no single "master" specification for this
      format.  An attempt at a common definition can be found in
      Section 2.

   Applications which use this media type:

      Spreadsheet programs and various data conversion utilities

   Additional information:

      Magic number(s): none

      File extension(s): CSV

A.3  Document History

   Changes from draft-shafranovich-mime-csv-04 to
   draft-shafranovich-mime-csv-05:

   o  Fixes in ABNF grammar: comma excluded from TEXTDATA and added to
      escaped text, 2*DQUOTE changed to 2DQUOTE.

   Changes from draft-shafranovich-mime-csv-03 to
   draft-shafranovich-mime-csv-04:

   o  Fixed ABNF grammar in response to IESG comments: VCHAR changed to
      TEXTDATA, DQUOTE excluded from TEXTDATA, spaces are included in
      TEXTDATA, CRLF taken out since CR and LF are already included.

   o  Added clarification that double quotes may not be included inside
      non-quoted fields.

   o  Added clarification that the same number of fields should appear
      in every line.

   o  Added the optional "header" parameter to indicate the presence or
      absence of a header line.

Internet-Draft        Format and MIME Type for CSV            April 2005

   Changes from draft-shafranovich-mime-csv-02 to
   draft-shafranovich-mime-csv-03:

   o  Changed text to prohibit the last field ending with a comma
      matching the ABNF grammar

   o  The double quote escaping is now set to two double quotes instead
      of three

   o  Moved some of the references between informative and normative
      sections

   Changes from draft-shafranovich-mime-csv-01 to
   draft-shafranovich-mime-csv-02:

   o  Minor errors in ABNF grammar corrected in response to AD comments

   o  Minor spelling mistakes corrected

   Changes from draft-shafranovich-mime-csv-00 to
   draft-shafranovich-mime-csv-01:

   o  Type "text/comma-separated-values" has been removed

   o  The "encoding consideration" paragraph of Section 3 has been
      changed to allow CRLF only as per section 4.1.1. of RFC 2046 [3].
      This has been reflected in the ABNF grammar in Section 2.

   o  ABNF grammar in Section 2 has been cleaned up.

   o  Acknowledgements and status sections were added.

   o  CSV format definition was moved to the normative section of the
      document

Internet-Draft        Format and MIME Type for CSV            April 2005

1.  Introduction

   The comma separated values format (CSV) has been used for exchanging
   and converting data between various spreadsheet programs for quite
   some time.  Surprisingly, while this format is very common it has
   never been formally documented.  Additionally, while the IANA MIME
   registration tree includes a registration for "text/
   tab-separated-values" type, no MIME types have ever been registered
   with IANA for CSV.  At the same time, various programs and operating
   systems have begun to use different MIME types for this format, many
   of which vary from system to system.  This document seeks to document
   the format of comma separated values (CSV) files and to formally
   register the "text/csv" MIME type for CSV in accordance with RFC 2048
   [1].

2.  Definition of the CSV format

   While there are various specifications and implementations for the
   CSV format (for ex. [4], [5], [6] and [7]), no formal specification
   exists which causes a wide variety of interpretations for CSV files.
   This section seeks to document the format that seems to be followed
   by most implementations:

   1.  Each record is located on a separate line delimited by a line
       break (CRLF).  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF

   2.  The last record in the file may or may not have an ending line
       break.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   3.  There maybe an optional header line appearing as the first line
       of the file with the same format as normal record lines.  This
       header will contain names corresponding to the fields in the file
       and should contain the same number of fields as the records in
       the rest of the file (the presence or absence of the header line
       should be indicated via the optional "header" parameter of this
       MIME type).  For example:

       field_name,field_name,field_name CRLF
       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF

Shafranovich             Expires October 7, 2005                [Page 3]
Internet-Draft        Format and MIME Type for CSV            April 2005

   4.  Within the header and each record there may be one or more
       fields, separated by commas.  Each line should contain the same
       number of fields throughout the file.  The last field in the
       record may not be followed by a comma.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc

   5.  Each field may or may not be enclosed in double quotes (however
       some programs such as Microsoft Excel do not use double quotes at
       all).  If fields are not enclosed with double quotes, then double
       quotes may not appear inside the fields.  For example:

       "aaa","bbb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   6.  Field containing line breaks (CRLF), double quotes and commas
       should be enclosed in double-quotes.  For example:

       "aaa","b CRLF
       bb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   7.  If double-quotes are used to enclosed fields, then a double-quote
       appearing inside a field must be escaped by preceding it with
       another double quote.  For example:

       "aaa","b""bb","ccc"

   The ABNF grammar [2] appears as follows:

      file = [header CRLF] record *(CRLF record) [CRLF]

      header = name *(COMMA name)

      record = field *(COMMA field)

      name = field

      field = (escaped / non-escaped)

      escaped = DQUOTE *(TEXTDATA / COMMA / CR / LF / 2DQUOTE) DQUOTE

      non-escaped = *TEXTDATA

      COMMA = %x2C

      CR = %x0D ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

Internet-Draft        Format and MIME Type for CSV            April 2005

      DQUOTE =  %x22 ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

      LF = %x0A ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

      CRLF = CR LF ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

      TEXTDATA =  %x20-21 / %x23-2B / %x2D-7E

3.  MIME Type Registration of text/csv

   This section provides the media-type registration application (as per
   RFC 2048 [1], which will be submitted to IANA after IESG approval of
   this document.

   To: ietf-types@iana.org

   Subject: Registration of MIME media type text/csv

   MIME media type name: text

   MIME subtype name: csv

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: charset, header

      Common usage of CSV is US-ASCII, but other character sets as
      defined by IANA for the "text" tree may be used in conjuction with
      the "charset" parameter.

      The "header" parameter indicates the presence or absence of the
      header line.  Valid values are "present" or "absent".
      Implementators choosing not to use this parameter must make their
      own decisions as to whether the header line is present or absent.

   Encoding considerations:

      As per section 4.1.1. of RFC 2046 [3], this media type uses CRLF
      to denote line breaks.  However, implementors should be aware that
      some implementations may use other values.

   Security considerations:

      CSV files contain passive text data which should not pose any
      risks.  However, it is possible in theory that malicious binary
      data maybe included in order to exploit potential buffer overruns
      in the program processing CSV data.  Additionally, private data

Internet-Draft        Format and MIME Type for CSV            April 2005

      maybe shared via this format (which of course applies to any text
      data).

   Interoperability considerations:

      Due to lack of a single specification there are considerable
      differences among different implementations.  Implementors should
      "be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept
      from others" (RFC 793 [8]) when processing CSV files.  An attempt
      at a common definition can be found in Section 2.

      Implementations deciding not to use the optional "header"
      parameter must make their own decision as to whether the header is
      absent or present.

   Published specification:

      While numerous private specifications exist for various programs
      and systems, there is no single "master" specification for this
      format.  An attempt at a common definition can be found in
      Section 2.

   Applications which use this media type:

      Spreadsheet programs and various data conversion utilities

   Additional information:

      Magic number(s): none

      File extension(s): CSV

      Macintosh File Type Code(s): TEXT

Internet-Draft        Format and MIME Type for CSV            April 2005

1.  Introduction

   The comma separated values format (CSV) has been used for exchanging
   and converting data between various spreadsheet programs for quite
   some time.  Surprisingly, while this format is very common it has
   never been formally documented.  Additionally, while the IANA MIME
   registration tree includes a registration for "text/
   tab-separated-values" type, no MIME types have ever been registered
   with IANA for CSV.  At the same time, various programs and operating
   systems have begun to use different MIME types for this format, many
   of which vary from system to system.  This document seeks to document
   the format of comma separated values (CSV) files and to formally
   register the "text/csv" MIME type for CSV in accordance with RFC 2048
   [1].

2.  Definition of the CSV format

   While there are various specifications and implementations for the
   CSV format (for ex. [4], [5], [6] and [7]), no formal specification
   exists which causes a wide variety of interpretations for CSV files.
   This section seeks to document the format that seems to be followed
   by most implementations:

   1.  Each record is located on a separate line delimited by a line
       break (CRLF).  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF

   2.  The last record in the file may or may not have an ending line
       break.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   3.  There maybe an optional header line appearing as the first line
       of the file with the same format as normal record lines.  This
       header will contain names corresponding to the fields in the file
       and should contain the same number of fields as the records in
       the rest of the file (the presence or absence of the header line
       should be indicated via the optional "header" parameter of this
       MIME type).  For example:

       field_name,field_name,field_name CRLF
       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF

Internet-Draft        Format and MIME Type for CSV            April 2005

   4.  Within the header and each record there may be one or more
       fields, separated by commas.  Each line should contain the same
       number of fields throughout the file.  The last field in the
       record may not be followed by a comma.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc

   5.  Each field may or may not be enclosed in double quotes (however
       some programs such as Microsoft Excel do not use double quotes at
       all).  If fields are not enclosed with double quotes, then double
       quotes may not appear inside the fields.  For example:

       "aaa","bbb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   6.  Field containing line breaks (CRLF), double quotes and commas
       should be enclosed in double-quotes.  For example:

       "aaa","b CRLF
       bb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   7.  If double-quotes are used to enclosed fields, then a double-quote
       appearing inside a field must be escaped by preceding it with
       another double quote.  For example:

       "aaa","b""bb","ccc"

   The ABNF grammar [2] appears as follows:

      file = [header CRLF] record *(CRLF record) [CRLF]

      header = name *(COMMA name)

      record = field *(COMMA field)

      name = field

      field = (escaped / non-escaped)

      escaped = DQUOTE *(TEXTDATA / COMMA / CR / LF / 2DQUOTE) DQUOTE

      non-escaped = *TEXTDATA

      COMMA = %x2C

      CR = %x0D ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

Internet-Draft        Format and MIME Type for CSV            April 2005

      DQUOTE =  %x22 ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

      LF = %x0A ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

      CRLF = CR LF ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

      TEXTDATA =  %x20-21 / %x23-2B / %x2D-7E

3.  MIME Type Registration of text/csv

   This section provides the media-type registration application (as per
   RFC 2048 [1], which will be submitted to IANA after IESG approval of
   this document.

   To: ietf-types@iana.org

   Subject: Registration of MIME media type text/csv

   MIME media type name: text

   MIME subtype name: csv

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: charset, header

      Common usage of CSV is US-ASCII, but other character sets as
      defined by IANA for the "text" tree may be used in conjuction with
      the "charset" parameter.

      The "header" parameter indicates the presence or absence of the
      header line.  Valid values are "present" or "absent".
      Implementators choosing not to use this parameter must make their
      own decisions as to whether the header line is present or absent.

   Encoding considerations:

      As per section 4.1.1. of RFC 2046 [3], this media type uses CRLF
      to denote line breaks.  However, implementors should be aware that
      some implementations may use other values.

   Security considerations:

      CSV files contain passive text data which should not pose any
      risks.  However, it is possible in theory that malicious binary
      data maybe included in order to exploit potential buffer overruns
      in the program processing CSV data.  Additionally, private data

Shafranovich             Expires October 7, 2005                [Page 5]
Internet-Draft        Format and MIME Type for CSV            April 2005

      maybe shared via this format (which of course applies to any text
      data).

   Interoperability considerations:

      Due to lack of a single specification there are considerable
      differences among different implementations.  Implementors should
      "be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept
      from others" (RFC 793 [8]) when processing CSV files.  An attempt
      at a common definition can be found in Section 2.

      Implementations deciding not to use the optional "header"
      parameter must make their own decision as to whether the header is
      absent or present.

   Published specification:

      While numerous private specifications exist for various programs
      and systems, there is no single "master" specification for this
      format.  An attempt at a common definition can be found in
      Section 2.

   Applications which use this media type:

      Spreadsheet programs and various data conversion utilities

   Additional information:

      Magic number(s): none

      File extension(s): CSV

      Macintosh File Type Code(s): TEXT

Internet-Draft        Format and MIME Type for CSV            April 2005


1.  Introduction

   The comma separated values format (CSV) has been used for exchanging
   and converting data between various spreadsheet programs for quite
   some time.  Surprisingly, while this format is very common it has
   never been formally documented.  Additionally, while the IANA MIME
   registration tree includes a registration for "text/
   tab-separated-values" type, no MIME types have ever been registered
   with IANA for CSV.  At the same time, various programs and operating
   systems have begun to use different MIME types for this format, many
   of which vary from system to system.  This document seeks to document
   the format of comma separated values (CSV) files and to formally
   register the "text/csv" MIME type for CSV in accordance with RFC 2048
   [1].

2.  Definition of the CSV format

   While there are various specifications and implementations for the
   CSV format (for ex. [4], [5], [6] and [7]), no formal specification
   exists which causes a wide variety of interpretations for CSV files.
   This section seeks to document the format that seems to be followed
   by most implementations:

   1.  Each record is located on a separate line delimited by a line
       break (CRLF).  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF

   2.  The last record in the file may or may not have an ending line
       break.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   3.  There maybe an optional header line appearing as the first line
       of the file with the same format as normal record lines.  This
       header will contain names corresponding to the fields in the file

   4.  Within the header and each record there may be one or more
       fields, separated by commas.  Each line should contain the same
       number of fields throughout the file.  The last field in the
       record may not be followed by a comma.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc

   5.  Each field may or may not be enclosed in double quotes (however
       some programs such as Microsoft Excel do not use double quotes at
       all).  If fields are not enclosed with double quotes, then double
       quotes may not appear inside the fields.  For example:

       "aaa","bbb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   6.  Field containing line breaks (CRLF), double quotes and commas
       should be enclosed in double-quotes.  For example:

       "aaa","b CRLF
       bb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   7.  If double-quotes are used to enclosed fields, then a double-quote
       appearing inside a field must be escaped by preceding it with
       another double quote.  For example:

       "aaa","b""bb","ccc"

   The ABNF grammar [2] appears as follows:

      file = [header CRLF] record *(CRLF record) [CRLF]

      header = name *(COMMA name)

      record = field *(COMMA field)

      name = field

      field = (escaped / non-escaped)

      escaped = DQUOTE *(TEXTDATA / COMMA / CR / LF / 2DQUOTE) DQUOTE

      non-escaped = *TEXTDATA

      COMMA = %x2C

      CR = %x0D ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   MIME subtype name: csv

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: charset, header

      Common usage of CSV is US-ASCII, but other character sets as
      defined by IANA for the "text" tree may be used in conjuction with
      the "charset" parameter.

      The "header" parameter indicates the presence or absence of the
      header line.  Valid values are "present" or "absent".
      Implementators choosing not to use this parameter must make their
      own decisions as to whether the header line is present or absent.

   Encoding considerations:

      As per section 4.1.1. of RFC 2046 [3], this media type uses CRLF
      to denote line breaks.  However, implementors should be aware that
      some implementations may use other values.

   Security considerations:

      CSV files contain passive text data which should not pose any
      risks.  However, it is possible in theory that malicious binary
      data maybe included in order to exploit potential buffer overruns
      in the program processing CSV data.  Additionally, private data

      maybe shared via this format (which of course applies to any text
      data).

   Interoperability considerations:

      Due to lack of a single specification there are considerable
      differences among different implementations.  Implementors should
      "be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept
      from others" (RFC 793 [8]) when processing CSV files.  An attempt
      at a common definition can be found in Section 2.

      Implementations deciding not to use the optional "header"
      parameter must make their own decision as to whether the header is
      absent or present.

   Published specification:

      While numerous private specifications exist for various programs
      and systems, there is no single "master" specification for this
      format.  An attempt at a common definition can be found in
      Section 2.

   Applications which use this media type:

      Spreadsheet programs and various data conversion utilities

   Additional information:

      Magic number(s): none

      File extension(s): CSV

      Macintosh File Type Code(s): TEXT

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


1.  Introduction

   The comma separated values format (CSV) has been used for exchanging
   and converting data between various spreadsheet programs for quite
   some time.  Surprisingly, while this format is very common, it has
   never been formally documented.  Additionally, while the IANA MIME
   registration tree includes a registration for
   "text/tab-separated-values" type, no MIME types have ever been
   registered with IANA for CSV.  At the same time, various programs and
   operating systems have begun to use different MIME types for this
   format.  This RFC documents the format of comma separated values
   (CSV) files and formally registers the "text/csv" MIME type for CSV
   in accordance with RFC 2048 [1].

2.  Definition of the CSV Format

   While there are various specifications and implementations for the
   CSV format (for ex. [4], [5], [6] and [7]), there is no formal
   specification in existence, which allows for a wide variety of
   interpretations of CSV files.  This section documents the format that
   seems to be followed by most implementations:

   1.  Each record is located on a separate line, delimited by a line
       break (CRLF).  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF

   2.  The last record in the file may or may not have an ending line
       break.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   3.  There maybe an optional header line appearing as the first line
       of the file with the same format as normal record lines.  This
       header will contain names corresponding to the fields in the file
       and should contain the same number of fields as the records in
       the rest of the file (the presence or absence of the header line
       should be indicated via the optional "header" parameter of this
       MIME type).  For example:

       field_name,field_name,field_name CRLF
       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF

   4.  Within the header and each record, there may be one or more
       fields, separated by commas.  Each line should contain the same
       number of fields throughout the file.  Spaces are considered part
       of a field and should not be ignored.  The last field in the
       record must not be followed by a comma.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc

   5.  Each field may or may not be enclosed in double quotes (however
       some programs, such as Microsoft Excel, do not use double quotes
       at all).  If fields are not enclosed with double quotes, then
       double quotes may not appear inside the fields.  For example:

       "aaa","bbb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   6.  Fields containing line breaks (CRLF), double quotes, and commas
       should be enclosed in double-quotes.  For example:

       "aaa","b CRLF
       bb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   7.  If double-quotes are used to enclose fields, then a double-quote
       appearing inside a field must be escaped by preceding it with
       another double quote.  For example:

       "aaa","b""bb","ccc"

   The ABNF grammar [2] appears as follows:

   file = [header CRLF] record *(CRLF record) [CRLF]

   header = name *(COMMA name)

   record = field *(COMMA field)

   name = field

   field = (escaped / non-escaped)

   escaped = DQUOTE *(TEXTDATA / COMMA / CR / LF / 2DQUOTE) DQUOTE

   non-escaped = *TEXTDATA

   COMMA = %x2C

   CR = %x0D ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

3.  MIME Type Registration of text/csv

   This section provides the media-type registration application (as per
   RFC 2048 [1].

   To: ietf-types@iana.org

   Subject: Registration of MIME media type text/csv

   MIME media type name: text

   MIME subtype name: csv

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: charset, header

      Common usage of CSV is US-ASCII, but other character sets defined
      by IANA for the "text" tree may be used in conjunction with the
      "charset" parameter.

      The "header" parameter indicates the presence or absence of the
      header line.  Valid values are "present" or "absent".
      Implementors choosing not to use this parameter must make their
      own decisions as to whether the header line is present or absent.

   Encoding considerations:

      As per section 4.1.1. of RFC 2046 [3], this media type uses CRLF
      to denote line breaks.  However, implementors should be aware that
      some implementations may use other values.

   Security considerations:

      CSV files contain passive text data that should not pose any
      risks.  However, it is possible in theory that malicious binary
      data may be included in order to exploit potential buffer overruns
      in the program processing CSV data.  Additionally, private data
      may be shared via this format (which of course applies to any text
      data).

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


   Interoperability considerations:

      Due to lack of a single specification, there are considerable
      differences among implementations.  Implementors should "be
      conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from
      others" (RFC 793 [8]) when processing CSV files.  An attempt at a
      common definition can be found in Section 2.

      Implementations deciding not to use the optional "header"
      parameter must make their own decision as to whether the header is
      absent or present.

   Published specification:

      While numerous private specifications exist for various programs
      and systems, there is no single "master" specification for this
      format.  An attempt at a common definition can be found in Section
      2.

   Applications that use this media type:

      Spreadsheet programs and various data conversion utilities

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


1.  Introduction

   The comma separated values format (CSV) has been used for exchanging
   and converting data between various spreadsheet programs for quite
   some time.  Surprisingly, while this format is very common, it has
   never been formally documented.  Additionally, while the IANA MIME
   registration tree includes a registration for
   "text/tab-separated-values" type, no MIME types have ever been
   registered with IANA for CSV.  At the same time, various programs and
   operating systems have begun to use different MIME types for this
   format.  This RFC documents the format of comma separated values
   (CSV) files and formally registers the "text/csv" MIME type for CSV
   in accordance with RFC 2048 [1].

2.  Definition of the CSV Format

   While there are various specifications and implementations for the
   CSV format (for ex. [4], [5], [6] and [7]), there is no formal
   specification in existence, which allows for a wide variety of
   interpretations of CSV files.  This section documents the format that
   seems to be followed by most implementations:

   1.  Each record is located on a separate line, delimited by a line
       break (CRLF).  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF

   2.  The last record in the file may or may not have an ending line
       break.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   3.  There maybe an optional header line appearing as the first line
       of the file with the same format as normal record lines.  This
       header will contain names corresponding to the fields in the file
       and should contain the same number of fields as the records in
       the rest of the file (the presence or absence of the header line
       should be indicated via the optional "header" parameter of this
       MIME type).  For example:

       field_name,field_name,field_name CRLF
       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF






Shafranovich                 Informational                      [Page 2]

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


   4.  Within the header and each record, there may be one or more
       fields, separated by commas.  Each line should contain the same
       number of fields throughout the file.  Spaces are considered part
       of a field and should not be ignored.  The last field in the
       record must not be followed by a comma.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc

   5.  Each field may or may not be enclosed in double quotes (however
       some programs, such as Microsoft Excel, do not use double quotes
       at all).  If fields are not enclosed with double quotes, then
       double quotes may not appear inside the fields.  For example:

       "aaa","bbb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   6.  Fields containing line breaks (CRLF), double quotes, and commas
       should be enclosed in double-quotes.  For example:

       "aaa","b CRLF
       bb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   7.  If double-quotes are used to enclose fields, then a double-quote
       appearing inside a field must be escaped by preceding it with
       another double quote.  For example:

       "aaa","b""bb","ccc"

   The ABNF grammar [2] appears as follows:

   file = [header CRLF] record *(CRLF record) [CRLF]

   header = name *(COMMA name)

   record = field *(COMMA field)

   name = field

   field = (escaped / non-escaped)

   escaped = DQUOTE *(TEXTDATA / COMMA / CR / LF / 2DQUOTE) DQUOTE

   non-escaped = *TEXTDATA

   COMMA = %x2C

   CR = %x0D ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   TEXTDATA =  %x20-21 / %x23-2B / %x2D-7E

3.  MIME Type Registration of text/csv

   This section provides the media-type registration application (as per
   RFC 2048 [1].

   To: ietf-types@iana.org

   Subject: Registration of MIME media type text/csv

   MIME media type name: text

   MIME subtype name: csv

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: charset, header

      Common usage of CSV is US-ASCII, but other character sets defined
      by IANA for the "text" tree may be used in conjunction with the
      "charset" parameter.

      The "header" parameter indicates the presence or absence of the
      header line.  Valid values are "present" or "absent".
      Implementors choosing not to use this parameter must make their
      own decisions as to whether the header line is present or absent.

   Encoding considerations:

      As per section 4.1.1. of RFC 2046 [3], this media type uses CRLF
      to denote line breaks.  However, implementors should be aware that
      some implementations may use other values.

   Security considerations:

      CSV files contain passive text data that should not pose any
      risks.  However, it is possible in theory that malicious binary
      data may be included in order to exploit potential buffer overruns
      in the program processing CSV data.  Additionally, private data
      may be shared via this format (which of course applies to any text
      data).

   4.  Within the header and each record, there may be one or more
       fields, separated by commas.  Each line should contain the same
       number of fields throughout the file.  Spaces are considered part
       of a field and should not be ignored.  The last field in the
       record must not be followed by a comma.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc

   5.  Each field may or may not be enclosed in double quotes (however
       some programs, such as Microsoft Excel, do not use double quotes
       at all).  If fields are not enclosed with double quotes, then
       double quotes may not appear inside the fields.  For example:

       "aaa","bbb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   6.  Fields containing line breaks (CRLF), double quotes, and commas
       should be enclosed in double-quotes.  For example:

       "aaa","b CRLF
       bb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   7.  If double-quotes are used to enclose fields, then a double-quote
       appearing inside a field must be escaped by preceding it with
       another double quote.  For example:

       "aaa","b""bb","ccc"

   The ABNF grammar [2] appears as follows:

   file = [header CRLF] record *(CRLF record) [CRLF]

   header = name *(COMMA name)

   record = field *(COMMA field)

   name = field

   field = (escaped / non-escaped)

   escaped = DQUOTE *(TEXTDATA / COMMA / CR / LF / 2DQUOTE) DQUOTE

   non-escaped = *TEXTDATA

   COMMA = %x2C

   CR = %x0D ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   DQUOTE =  %x22 ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   LF = %x0A ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   CRLF = CR LF ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   TEXTDATA =  %x20-21 / %x23-2B / %x2D-7E

3.  MIME Type Registration of text/csv

   This section provides the media-type registration application (as per
   RFC 2048 [1].

   To: ietf-types@iana.org

   Subject: Registration of MIME media type text/csv

   MIME media type name: text

   MIME subtype name: csv

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: charset, header

      Common usage of CSV is US-ASCII, but other character sets defined
      by IANA for the "text" tree may be used in conjunction with the
      "charset" parameter.

      The "header" parameter indicates the presence or absence of the
      header line.  Valid values are "present" or "absent".
      Implementors choosing not to use this parameter must make their
      own decisions as to whether the header line is present or absent.

   Encoding considerations:

      As per section 4.1.1. of RFC 2046 [3], this media type uses CRLF
      to denote line breaks.  However, implementors should be aware that
      some implementations may use other values.

   Security considerations:

      CSV files contain passive text data that should not pose any
      risks.  However, it is possible in theory that malicious binary
      data may be included in order to exploit potential buffer overruns
      in the program processing CSV data.  Additionally, private data
      may be shared via this format (which of course applies to any text
      data).

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


   Interoperability considerations:

      Due to lack of a single specification, there are considerable
      differences among implementations.  Implementors should "be
      conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from
      others" (RFC 793 [8]) when processing CSV files.  An attempt at a
      common definition can be found in Section 2.

      Implementations deciding not to use the optional "header"
      parameter must make their own decision as to whether the header is
      absent or present.

   Published specification:

      While numerous private specifications exist for various programs
      and systems, there is no single "master" specification for this
      format.  An attempt at a common definition can be found in Section
      2.

   Applications that use this media type:

      Spreadsheet programs and various data conversion utilities

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


1.  Introduction

   The comma separated values format (CSV) has been used for exchanging
   and converting data between various spreadsheet programs for quite
   some time.  Surprisingly, while this format is very common, it has
   never been formally documented.  Additionally, while the IANA MIME
   registration tree includes a registration for
   "text/tab-separated-values" type, no MIME types have ever been
   registered with IANA for CSV.  At the same time, various programs and
   operating systems have begun to use different MIME types for this
   format.  This RFC documents the format of comma separated values
   (CSV) files and formally registers the "text/csv" MIME type for CSV
   in accordance with RFC 2048 [1].

2.  Definition of the CSV Format

   While there are various specifications and implementations for the
   CSV format (for ex. [4], [5], [6] and [7]), there is no formal
   specification in existence, which allows for a wide variety of
   interpretations of CSV files.  This section documents the format that
   seems to be followed by most implementations:

   1.  Each record is located on a separate line, delimited by a line
       break (CRLF).  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF

   2.  The last record in the file may or may not have an ending line
       break.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   3.  There maybe an optional header line appearing as the first line
       of the file with the same format as normal record lines.  This
       header will contain names corresponding to the fields in the file
       and should contain the same number of fields as the records in
       the rest of the file (the presence or absence of the header line
       should be indicated via the optional "header" parameter of this
       MIME type).  For example:

       field_name,field_name,field_name CRLF
       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF






Shafranovich                 Informational                      [Page 2]

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


   4.  Within the header and each record, there may be one or more
       fields, separated by commas.  Each line should contain the same
       number of fields throughout the file.  Spaces are considered part
       of a field and should not be ignored.  The last field in the
       record must not be followed by a comma.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc

   5.  Each field may or may not be enclosed in double quotes (however
       some programs, such as Microsoft Excel, do not use double quotes
       at all).  If fields are not enclosed with double quotes, then
       double quotes may not appear inside the fields.  For example:

       "aaa","bbb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   6.  Fields containing line breaks (CRLF), double quotes, and commas
       should be enclosed in double-quotes.  For example:

       "aaa","b CRLF
       bb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   7.  If double-quotes are used to enclose fields, then a double-quote
       appearing inside a field must be escaped by preceding it with
       another double quote.  For example:

       "aaa","b""bb","ccc"

   The ABNF grammar [2] appears as follows:

   file = [header CRLF] record *(CRLF record) [CRLF]

   header = name *(COMMA name)

   record = field *(COMMA field)

   name = field

   field = (escaped / non-escaped)

   escaped = DQUOTE *(TEXTDATA / COMMA / CR / LF / 2DQUOTE) DQUOTE

   non-escaped = *TEXTDATA

   COMMA = %x2C

   CR = %x0D ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   DQUOTE =  %x22 ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   LF = %x0A ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   CRLF = CR LF ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   TEXTDATA =  %x20-21 / %x23-2B / %x2D-7E

3.  MIME Type Registration of text/csv

   This section provides the media-type registration application (as per
   RFC 2048 [1].

   To: ietf-types@iana.org

   Subject: Registration of MIME media type text/csv

   MIME media type name: text

   MIME subtype name: csv

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: charset, header

      Common usage of CSV is US-ASCII, but other character sets defined
      by IANA for the "text" tree may be used in conjunction with the
      "charset" parameter.

      The "header" parameter indicates the presence or absence of the
      header line.  Valid values are "present" or "absent".
      Implementors choosing not to use this parameter must make their
      own decisions as to whether the header line is present or absent.

   Encoding considerations:

      As per section 4.1.1. of RFC 2046 [3], this media type uses CRLF
      to denote line breaks.  However, implementors should be aware that
      some implementations may use other values.

   Security considerations:

      CSV files contain passive text data that should not pose any
      risks.  However, it is possible in theory that malicious binary
      data may be included in order to exploit potential buffer overruns
      in the program processing CSV data.  Additionally, private data
      may be shared via this format (which of course applies to any text
      data).

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


1.  Introduction

   The comma separated values format (CSV) has been used for exchanging
   and converting data between various spreadsheet programs for quite
   some time.  Surprisingly, while this format is very common, it has
   never been formally documented.  Additionally, while the IANA MIME
   registration tree includes a registration for
   "text/tab-separated-values" type, no MIME types have ever been
   registered with IANA for CSV.  At the same time, various programs and
   operating systems have begun to use different MIME types for this
   format.  This RFC documents the format of comma separated values
   (CSV) files and formally registers the "text/csv" MIME type for CSV
   in accordance with RFC 2048 [1].

2.  Definition of the CSV Format

   While there are various specifications and implementations for the
   CSV format (for ex. [4], [5], [6] and [7]), there is no formal
   specification in existence, which allows for a wide variety of
   interpretations of CSV files.  This section documents the format that
   seems to be followed by most implementations:

   1.  Each record is located on a separate line, delimited by a line
       break (CRLF).  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF

   2.  The last record in the file may or may not have an ending line
       break.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   3.  There maybe an optional header line appearing as the first line
       of the file with the same format as normal record lines.  This
       header will contain names corresponding to the fields in the file
       and should contain the same number of fields as the records in
       the rest of the file (the presence or absence of the header line
       should be indicated via the optional "header" parameter of this
       MIME type).  For example:

       field_name,field_name,field_name CRLF
       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF






Shafranovich                 Informational                      [Page 2]

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


   4.  Within the header and each record, there may be one or more
       fields, separated by commas.  Each line should contain the same
       number of fields throughout the file.  Spaces are considered part
       of a field and should not be ignored.  The last field in the
       record must not be followed by a comma.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc

   5.  Each field may or may not be enclosed in double quotes (however
       some programs, such as Microsoft Excel, do not use double quotes
       at all).  If fields are not enclosed with double quotes, then
       double quotes may not appear inside the fields.  For example:

       "aaa","bbb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   6.  Fields containing line breaks (CRLF), double quotes, and commas
       should be enclosed in double-quotes.  For example:

       "aaa","b CRLF
       bb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   7.  If double-quotes are used to enclose fields, then a double-quote
       appearing inside a field must be escaped by preceding it with
       another double quote.  For example:

       "aaa","b""bb","ccc"

   The ABNF grammar [2] appears as follows:

   file = [header CRLF] record *(CRLF record) [CRLF]

   header = name *(COMMA name)

   record = field *(COMMA field)

   name = field

   field = (escaped / non-escaped)

   escaped = DQUOTE *(TEXTDATA / COMMA / CR / LF / 2DQUOTE) DQUOTE

   non-escaped = *TEXTDATA

   COMMA = %x2C

   CR = %x0D ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


   DQUOTE =  %x22 ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   LF = %x0A ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   CRLF = CR LF ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   TEXTDATA =  %x20-21 / %x23-2B / %x2D-7E

3.  MIME Type Registration of text/csv

   This section provides the media-type registration application (as per
   RFC 2048 [1].

   To: ietf-types@iana.org

   Subject: Registration of MIME media type text/csv

   MIME media type name: text

   MIME subtype name: csv

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: charset, header

      Common usage of CSV is US-ASCII, but other character sets defined
      by IANA for the "text" tree may be used in conjunction with the
      "charset" parameter.

      The "header" parameter indicates the presence or absence of the
      header line.  Valid values are "present" or "absent".
      Implementors choosing not to use this parameter must make their
      own decisions as to whether the header line is present or absent.

   Encoding considerations:

      As per section 4.1.1. of RFC 2046 [3], this media type uses CRLF
      to denote line breaks.  However, implementors should be aware that
      some implementations may use other values.

   Security considerations:

      CSV files contain passive text data that should not pose any
      risks.  However, it is possible in theory that malicious binary
      data may be included in order to exploit potential buffer overruns
      in the program processing CSV data.  Additionally, private data
      may be shared via this format (which of course applies to any text
      data).

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


   Interoperability considerations:

      Due to lack of a single specification, there are considerable
      differences among implementations.  Implementors should "be
      conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from
      others" (RFC 793 [8]) when processing CSV files.  An attempt at a
      common definition can be found in Section 2.

      Implementations deciding not to use the optional "header"
      parameter must make their own decision as to whether the header is
      absent or present.

   Published specification:

      While numerous private specifications exist for various programs
      and systems, there is no single "master" specification for this
      format.  An attempt at a common definition can be found in Section
      2.

   Applications that use this media type:

      Spreadsheet programs and various data conversion utilities

1.  Introduction

   The comma separated values format (CSV) has been used for exchanging
   and converting data between various spreadsheet programs for quite
   some time.  Surprisingly, while this format is very common, it has
   never been formally documented.  Additionally, while the IANA MIME
   registration tree includes a registration for
   "text/tab-separated-values" type, no MIME types have ever been
   registered with IANA for CSV.  At the same time, various programs and
   operating systems have begun to use different MIME types for this
   format.  This RFC documents the format of comma separated values
   (CSV) files and formally registers the "text/csv" MIME type for CSV
   in accordance with RFC 2048 [1].

2.  Definition of the CSV Format

   While there are various specifications and implementations for the
   CSV format (for ex. [4], [5], [6] and [7]), there is no formal
   specification in existence, which allows for a wide variety of
   interpretations of CSV files.  This section documents the format that

       break.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   3.  There maybe an optional header line appearing as the first line
       of the file with the same format as normal record lines.  This
       header will contain names corresponding to the fields in the file
       and should contain the same number of fields as the records in
       the rest of the file (the presence or absence of the header line
       should be indicated via the optional "header" parameter of this
       MIME type).  For example:

   4.  Within the header and each record, there may be one or more
       fields, separated by commas.  Each line should contain the same
       number of fields throughout the file.  Spaces are considered part
       of a field and should not be ignored.  The last field in the
       record must not be followed by a comma.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc

   5.  Each field may or may not be enclosed in double quotes (however
       some programs, such as Microsoft Excel, do not use double quotes
       at all).  If fields are not enclosed with double quotes, then
       double quotes may not appear inside the fields.  For example:

       "aaa","bbb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   6.  Fields containing line breaks (CRLF), double quotes, and commas
       should be enclosed in double-quotes.  For example:

       "aaa","b CRLF
       bb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   7.  If double-quotes are used to enclose fields, then a double-quote
       appearing inside a field must be escaped by preceding it with
       another double quote.  For example:

       "aaa","b""bb","ccc"

   The ABNF grammar [2] appears as follows:

   file = [header CRLF] record *(CRLF record) [CRLF]

   header = name *(COMMA name)

   record = field *(COMMA field)

   name = field

   field = (escaped / non-escaped)

   escaped = DQUOTE *(TEXTDATA / COMMA / CR / LF / 2DQUOTE) DQUOTE

   non-escaped = *TEXTDATA

   COMMA = %x2C

   CR = %x0D ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

3.  MIME Type Registration of text/csv

   This section provides the media-type registration application (as per
   RFC 2048 [1].

   Subject: Registration of MIME media type text/csv

      CSV files contain passive text data that should not pose any
      risks.  However, it is possible in theory that malicious binary
      data may be included in order to exploit potential buffer overruns
      in the program processing CSV data.  Additionally, private data

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


1.  Introduction

   The comma separated values format (CSV) has been used for exchanging
   and converting data between various spreadsheet programs for quite
   some time.  Surprisingly, while this format is very common, it has
   never been formally documented.  Additionally, while the IANA MIME
   registration tree includes a registration for
   "text/tab-separated-values" type, no MIME types have ever been
   registered with IANA for CSV.  At the same time, various programs and
   operating systems have begun to use different MIME types for this
   format.  This RFC documents the format of comma separated values
   (CSV) files and formally registers the "text/csv" MIME type for CSV
   in accordance with RFC 2048 [1].

2.  Definition of the CSV Format

   While there are various specifications and implementations for the
   CSV format (for ex. [4], [5], [6] and [7]), there is no formal
   specification in existence, which allows for a wide variety of
   interpretations of CSV files.  This section documents the format that
   seems to be followed by most implementations:

   1.  Each record is located on a separate line, delimited by a line
       break (CRLF).  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF

   2.  The last record in the file may or may not have an ending line
       break.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   3.  There maybe an optional header line appearing as the first line
       of the file with the same format as normal record lines.  This
       header will contain names corresponding to the fields in the file
       and should contain the same number of fields as the records in
       the rest of the file (the presence or absence of the header line
       should be indicated via the optional "header" parameter of this
       MIME type).  For example:

       field_name,field_name,field_name CRLF
       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF






Shafranovich                 Informational                      [Page 2]

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


   4.  Within the header and each record, there may be one or more
       fields, separated by commas.  Each line should contain the same
       number of fields throughout the file.  Spaces are considered part
       of a field and should not be ignored.  The last field in the
       record must not be followed by a comma.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc

   5.  Each field may or may not be enclosed in double quotes (however
       some programs, such as Microsoft Excel, do not use double quotes
       at all).  If fields are not enclosed with double quotes, then
       double quotes may not appear inside the fields.  For example:

       "aaa","bbb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   6.  Fields containing line breaks (CRLF), double quotes, and commas
       should be enclosed in double-quotes.  For example:

       "aaa","b CRLF
       bb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   7.  If double-quotes are used to enclose fields, then a double-quote
       appearing inside a field must be escaped by preceding it with
       another double quote.  For example:

       "aaa","b""bb","ccc"

   The ABNF grammar [2] appears as follows:

   file = [header CRLF] record *(CRLF record) [CRLF]

   header = name *(COMMA name)

   record = field *(COMMA field)

   name = field

   field = (escaped / non-escaped)

   escaped = DQUOTE *(TEXTDATA / COMMA / CR / LF / 2DQUOTE) DQUOTE

   non-escaped = *TEXTDATA

   COMMA = %x2C

   CR = %x0D ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


   DQUOTE =  %x22 ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   LF = %x0A ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   CRLF = CR LF ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   TEXTDATA =  %x20-21 / %x23-2B / %x2D-7E

3.  MIME Type Registration of text/csv

   This section provides the media-type registration application (as per
   RFC 2048 [1].

   To: ietf-types@iana.org

   Subject: Registration of MIME media type text/csv

   MIME media type name: text

   MIME subtype name: csv

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: charset, header

      Common usage of CSV is US-ASCII, but other character sets defined
      by IANA for the "text" tree may be used in conjunction with the
      "charset" parameter.

      The "header" parameter indicates the presence or absence of the
      header line.  Valid values are "present" or "absent".
      Implementors choosing not to use this parameter must make their
      own decisions as to whether the header line is present or absent.

   Encoding considerations:

      As per section 4.1.1. of RFC 2046 [3], this media type uses CRLF
      to denote line breaks.  However, implementors should be aware that
      some implementations may use other values.

   Security considerations:

      CSV files contain passive text data that should not pose any
      risks.  However, it is possible in theory that malicious binary
      data may be included in order to exploit potential buffer overruns
      in the program processing CSV data.  Additionally, private data
      may be shared via this format (which of course applies to any text
      data).

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


   Interoperability considerations:

      Due to lack of a single specification, there are considerable
      differences among implementations.  Implementors should "be
      conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from
      others" (RFC 793 [8]) when processing CSV files.  An attempt at a
      common definition can be found in Section 2.

      Implementations deciding not to use the optional "header"
      parameter must make their own decision as to whether the header is
      absent or present.

   Published specification:

      While numerous private specifications exist for various programs
      and systems, there is no single "master" specification for this
      format.  An attempt at a common definition can be found in Section
      2.

   Applications that use this media type:

      Spreadsheet programs and various data conversion utilities

   The comma separated values format (CSV) has been used for exchanging

2.  Definition of the CSV Format

   While there are various specifications and implementations for the
   CSV format (for ex. [4], [5], [6] and [7]), there is no formal
   specification in existence, which allows for a wide variety of
   interpretations of CSV files.  This section documents the format that

   4.  Within the header and each record, there may be one or more
       fields, separated by commas.  Each line should contain the same
       number of fields throughout the file.  Spaces are considered part
       of a field and should not be ignored.  The last field in the
       record must not be followed by a comma.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc

   5.  Each field may or may not be enclosed in double quotes (however
       some programs, such as Microsoft Excel, do not use double quotes
       at all).  If fields are not enclosed with double quotes, then
       double quotes may not appear inside the fields.  For example:

       "aaa","bbb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   6.  Fields containing line breaks (CRLF), double quotes, and commas
       should be enclosed in double-quotes.  For example:

       "aaa","b CRLF
       bb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   7.  If double-quotes are used to enclose fields, then a double-quote
       appearing inside a field must be escaped by preceding it with
       another double quote.  For example:

       "aaa","b""bb","ccc"

   The ABNF grammar [2] appears as follows:

   file = [header CRLF] record *(CRLF record) [CRLF]

   header = name *(COMMA name)

   record = field *(COMMA field)

   name = field

   field = (escaped / non-escaped)

   escaped = DQUOTE *(TEXTDATA / COMMA / CR / LF / 2DQUOTE) DQUOTE

   non-escaped = *TEXTDATA

   COMMA = %x2C

   CR = %x0D ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   Subject: Registration of MIME media type text/csv

      CSV files contain passive text data that should not pose any
      risks.  However, it is possible in theory that malicious binary
      data may be included in order to exploit potential buffer overruns
      in the program processing CSV data.  Additionally, private data

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


1.  Introduction

   The comma separated values format (CSV) has been used for exchanging
   and converting data between various spreadsheet programs for quite
   some time.  Surprisingly, while this format is very common, it has
   never been formally documented.  Additionally, while the IANA MIME
   registration tree includes a registration for
   "text/tab-separated-values" type, no MIME types have ever been
   registered with IANA for CSV.  At the same time, various programs and
   operating systems have begun to use different MIME types for this
   format.  This RFC documents the format of comma separated values
   (CSV) files and formally registers the "text/csv" MIME type for CSV
   in accordance with RFC 2048 [1].

2.  Definition of the CSV Format

   While there are various specifications and implementations for the
   CSV format (for ex. [4], [5], [6] and [7]), there is no formal
   specification in existence, which allows for a wide variety of
   interpretations of CSV files.  This section documents the format that
   seems to be followed by most implementations:

   1.  Each record is located on a separate line, delimited by a line
       break (CRLF).  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF

   2.  The last record in the file may or may not have an ending line
       break.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   3.  There maybe an optional header line appearing as the first line
       of the file with the same format as normal record lines.  This
       header will contain names corresponding to the fields in the file
       and should contain the same number of fields as the records in
       the rest of the file (the presence or absence of the header line
       should be indicated via the optional "header" parameter of this
       MIME type).  For example:

       field_name,field_name,field_name CRLF
       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF






Shafranovich                 Informational                      [Page 2]

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


   4.  Within the header and each record, there may be one or more
       fields, separated by commas.  Each line should contain the same
       number of fields throughout the file.  Spaces are considered part
       of a field and should not be ignored.  The last field in the
       record must not be followed by a comma.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc

   5.  Each field may or may not be enclosed in double quotes (however
       some programs, such as Microsoft Excel, do not use double quotes
       at all).  If fields are not enclosed with double quotes, then
       double quotes may not appear inside the fields.  For example:

       "aaa","bbb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   6.  Fields containing line breaks (CRLF), double quotes, and commas
       should be enclosed in double-quotes.  For example:

       "aaa","b CRLF
       bb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   7.  If double-quotes are used to enclose fields, then a double-quote
       appearing inside a field must be escaped by preceding it with
       another double quote.  For example:

       "aaa","b""bb","ccc"

   The ABNF grammar [2] appears as follows:

   file = [header CRLF] record *(CRLF record) [CRLF]

   header = name *(COMMA name)

   record = field *(COMMA field)

   name = field

   field = (escaped / non-escaped)

   escaped = DQUOTE *(TEXTDATA / COMMA / CR / LF / 2DQUOTE) DQUOTE

   non-escaped = *TEXTDATA

   COMMA = %x2C

   CR = %x0D ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


   DQUOTE =  %x22 ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   LF = %x0A ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   CRLF = CR LF ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   TEXTDATA =  %x20-21 / %x23-2B / %x2D-7E

3.  MIME Type Registration of text/csv

   This section provides the media-type registration application (as per
   RFC 2048 [1].

   To: ietf-types@iana.org

   Subject: Registration of MIME media type text/csv

   MIME media type name: text

   MIME subtype name: csv

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: charset, header

      Common usage of CSV is US-ASCII, but other character sets defined
      by IANA for the "text" tree may be used in conjunction with the
      "charset" parameter.

      The "header" parameter indicates the presence or absence of the
      header line.  Valid values are "present" or "absent".
      Implementors choosing not to use this parameter must make their
      own decisions as to whether the header line is present or absent.

   Encoding considerations:

      As per section 4.1.1. of RFC 2046 [3], this media type uses CRLF
      to denote line breaks.  However, implementors should be aware that
      some implementations may use other values.

   Security considerations:

      CSV files contain passive text data that should not pose any
      risks.  However, it is possible in theory that malicious binary
      data may be included in order to exploit potential buffer overruns
      in the program processing CSV data.  Additionally, private data
      may be shared via this format (which of course applies to any text
      data).

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


   Interoperability considerations:

      Due to lack of a single specification, there are considerable
      differences among implementations.  Implementors should "be
      conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from
      others" (RFC 793 [8]) when processing CSV files.  An attempt at a
      common definition can be found in Section 2.

      Implementations deciding not to use the optional "header"
      parameter must make their own decision as to whether the header is
      absent or present.

   Published specification:

      While numerous private specifications exist for various programs
      and systems, there is no single "master" specification for this
      format.  An attempt at a common definition can be found in Section
      2.

   Applications that use this media type:

      Spreadsheet programs and various data conversion utilities

   Additional information:

      Magic number(s): none

      File extension(s): CSV

      Macintosh File Type Code(s): TEXT

   The comma separated values format (CSV) has been used for exchanging

   never been formally documented.  Additionally, while the IANA MIME

2.  Definition of the CSV Format

   While there are various specifications and implementations for the
   CSV format (for ex. [4], [5], [6] and [7]), there is no formal
   specification in existence, which allows for a wide variety of
   interpretations of CSV files.  This section documents the format that

       should be indicated via the optional "header" parameter of this
       MIME type).  For example:

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


   4.  Within the header and each record, there may be one or more
       fields, separated by commas.  Each line should contain the same
       number of fields throughout the file.  Spaces are considered part
       of a field and should not be ignored.  The last field in the
       record must not be followed by a comma.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc

   5.  Each field may or may not be enclosed in double quotes (however
       some programs, such as Microsoft Excel, do not use double quotes
       at all).  If fields are not enclosed with double quotes, then
       double quotes may not appear inside the fields.  For example:

       "aaa","bbb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   6.  Fields containing line breaks (CRLF), double quotes, and commas
       should be enclosed in double-quotes.  For example:

       "aaa","b CRLF
       bb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   7.  If double-quotes are used to enclose fields, then a double-quote
       appearing inside a field must be escaped by preceding it with
       another double quote.  For example:

       "aaa","b""bb","ccc"

   The ABNF grammar [2] appears as follows:

   file = [header CRLF] record *(CRLF record) [CRLF]

   header = name *(COMMA name)

   record = field *(COMMA field)

   name = field

   field = (escaped / non-escaped)

   escaped = DQUOTE *(TEXTDATA / COMMA / CR / LF / 2DQUOTE) DQUOTE

   non-escaped = *TEXTDATA

   COMMA = %x2C

   CR = %x0D ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

3.  MIME Type Registration of text/csv

   This section provides the media-type registration application (as per
   RFC 2048 [1].

   To: ietf-types@iana.org

   Subject: Registration of MIME media type text/csv

   MIME media type name: text

   MIME subtype name: csv

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: charset, header

      Common usage of CSV is US-ASCII, but other character sets defined
      by IANA for the "text" tree may be used in conjunction with the
      "charset" parameter.

      The "header" parameter indicates the presence or absence of the
      header line.  Valid values are "present" or "absent".
      Implementors choosing not to use this parameter must make their
      own decisions as to whether the header line is present or absent.

   Encoding considerations:

      As per section 4.1.1. of RFC 2046 [3], this media type uses CRLF
      to denote line breaks.  However, implementors should be aware that
      some implementations may use other values.

   Security considerations:

      CSV files contain passive text data that should not pose any
      risks.  However, it is possible in theory that malicious binary
      data may be included in order to exploit potential buffer overruns
      in the program processing CSV data.  Additionally, private data
      may be shared via this format (which of course applies to any text
      data).

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


1.  Introduction

   The comma separated values format (CSV) has been used for exchanging
   and converting data between various spreadsheet programs for quite
   some time.  Surprisingly, while this format is very common, it has
   never been formally documented.  Additionally, while the IANA MIME
   registration tree includes a registration for
   "text/tab-separated-values" type, no MIME types have ever been
   registered with IANA for CSV.  At the same time, various programs and
   operating systems have begun to use different MIME types for this
   format.  This RFC documents the format of comma separated values
   (CSV) files and formally registers the "text/csv" MIME type for CSV
   in accordance with RFC 2048 [1].

2.  Definition of the CSV Format

   While there are various specifications and implementations for the
   CSV format (for ex. [4], [5], [6] and [7]), there is no formal
   specification in existence, which allows for a wide variety of
   interpretations of CSV files.  This section documents the format that
   seems to be followed by most implementations:

   1.  Each record is located on a separate line, delimited by a line
       break (CRLF).  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF

   2.  The last record in the file may or may not have an ending line
       break.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   3.  There maybe an optional header line appearing as the first line
       of the file with the same format as normal record lines.  This
       header will contain names corresponding to the fields in the file
       and should contain the same number of fields as the records in
       the rest of the file (the presence or absence of the header line
       should be indicated via the optional "header" parameter of this
       MIME type).  For example:

       field_name,field_name,field_name CRLF
       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF






Shafranovich                 Informational                      [Page 2]

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


   4.  Within the header and each record, there may be one or more
       fields, separated by commas.  Each line should contain the same
       number of fields throughout the file.  Spaces are considered part
       of a field and should not be ignored.  The last field in the
       record must not be followed by a comma.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc

   5.  Each field may or may not be enclosed in double quotes (however
       some programs, such as Microsoft Excel, do not use double quotes
       at all).  If fields are not enclosed with double quotes, then
       double quotes may not appear inside the fields.  For example:

       "aaa","bbb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   6.  Fields containing line breaks (CRLF), double quotes, and commas
       should be enclosed in double-quotes.  For example:

       "aaa","b CRLF
       bb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   7.  If double-quotes are used to enclose fields, then a double-quote
       appearing inside a field must be escaped by preceding it with
       another double quote.  For example:

       "aaa","b""bb","ccc"

   The ABNF grammar [2] appears as follows:

   file = [header CRLF] record *(CRLF record) [CRLF]

   header = name *(COMMA name)

   record = field *(COMMA field)

   name = field

   field = (escaped / non-escaped)

   escaped = DQUOTE *(TEXTDATA / COMMA / CR / LF / 2DQUOTE) DQUOTE

   non-escaped = *TEXTDATA

   COMMA = %x2C

   CR = %x0D ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


   DQUOTE =  %x22 ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   LF = %x0A ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   CRLF = CR LF ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   TEXTDATA =  %x20-21 / %x23-2B / %x2D-7E

3.  MIME Type Registration of text/csv

   This section provides the media-type registration application (as per
   RFC 2048 [1].

   To: ietf-types@iana.org

   Subject: Registration of MIME media type text/csv

   MIME media type name: text

   MIME subtype name: csv

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: charset, header

      Common usage of CSV is US-ASCII, but other character sets defined
      by IANA for the "text" tree may be used in conjunction with the
      "charset" parameter.

      The "header" parameter indicates the presence or absence of the
      header line.  Valid values are "present" or "absent".
      Implementors choosing not to use this parameter must make their
      own decisions as to whether the header line is present or absent.

   Encoding considerations:

      As per section 4.1.1. of RFC 2046 [3], this media type uses CRLF
      to denote line breaks.  However, implementors should be aware that
      some implementations may use other values.

   Security considerations:

      CSV files contain passive text data that should not pose any
      risks.  However, it is possible in theory that malicious binary
      data may be included in order to exploit potential buffer overruns
      in the program processing CSV data.  Additionally, private data
      may be shared via this format (which of course applies to any text
      data).

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


   Interoperability considerations:

      Due to lack of a single specification, there are considerable
      differences among implementations.  Implementors should "be
      conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from
      others" (RFC 793 [8]) when processing CSV files.  An attempt at a
      common definition can be found in Section 2.

      Implementations deciding not to use the optional "header"
      parameter must make their own decision as to whether the header is
      absent or present.

   Published specification:

      While numerous private specifications exist for various programs
      and systems, there is no single "master" specification for this
      format.  An attempt at a common definition can be found in Section
      2.

   Applications that use this media type:

      Spreadsheet programs and various data conversion utilities

   The comma separated values format (CSV) has been used for exchanging

   never been formally documented.  Additionally, while the IANA MIME

2.  Definition of the CSV Format

   While there are various specifications and implementations for the
   CSV format (for ex. [4], [5], [6] and [7]), there is no formal
   specification in existence, which allows for a wide variety of
   interpretations of CSV files.  This section documents the format that

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


   4.  Within the header and each record, there may be one or more
       fields, separated by commas.  Each line should contain the same
       number of fields throughout the file.  Spaces are considered part
       of a field and should not be ignored.  The last field in the
       record must not be followed by a comma.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc

   5.  Each field may or may not be enclosed in double quotes (however
       some programs, such as Microsoft Excel, do not use double quotes
       at all).  If fields are not enclosed with double quotes, then
       double quotes may not appear inside the fields.  For example:

       "aaa","bbb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   6.  Fields containing line breaks (CRLF), double quotes, and commas
       should be enclosed in double-quotes.  For example:

       "aaa","b CRLF
       bb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   7.  If double-quotes are used to enclose fields, then a double-quote
       appearing inside a field must be escaped by preceding it with
       another double quote.  For example:

       "aaa","b""bb","ccc"

   The ABNF grammar [2] appears as follows:

   file = [header CRLF] record *(CRLF record) [CRLF]

   header = name *(COMMA name)

   record = field *(COMMA field)

   name = field

   field = (escaped / non-escaped)

   escaped = DQUOTE *(TEXTDATA / COMMA / CR / LF / 2DQUOTE) DQUOTE

   non-escaped = *TEXTDATA

   COMMA = %x2C

   CR = %x0D ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

      by IANA for the "text" tree may be used in conjunction with the
      "charset" parameter.

      The "header" parameter indicates the presence or absence of the
      header line.  Valid values are "present" or "absent".
      Implementors choosing not to use this parameter must make their
      own decisions as to whether the header line is present or absent.

   Encoding considerations:

      As per section 4.1.1. of RFC 2046 [3], this media type uses CRLF
      to denote line breaks.  However, implementors should be aware that
      some implementations may use other values.

   Security considerations:

      CSV files contain passive text data that should not pose any
      risks.  However, it is possible in theory that malicious binary
      data may be included in order to exploit potential buffer overruns
      in the program processing CSV data.  Additionally, private data
      may be shared via this format (which of course applies to any text
      data).

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


   Interoperability considerations:

      Due to lack of a single specification, there are considerable
      differences among implementations.  Implementors should "be
      conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from
      others" (RFC 793 [8]) when processing CSV files.  An attempt at a
      common definition can be found in Section 2.

      Implementations deciding not to use the optional "header"
      parameter must make their own decision as to whether the header is
      absent or present.

   Published specification:

      While numerous private specifications exist for various programs
      and systems, there is no single "master" specification for this
      format.  An attempt at a common definition can be found in Section
      2.

   Applications that use this media type:

      Spreadsheet programs and various data conversion utilities

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


1.  Introduction

   The comma separated values format (CSV) has been used for exchanging
   and converting data between various spreadsheet programs for quite
   some time.  Surprisingly, while this format is very common, it has
   never been formally documented.  Additionally, while the IANA MIME
   registration tree includes a registration for
   "text/tab-separated-values" type, no MIME types have ever been
   registered with IANA for CSV.  At the same time, various programs and
   operating systems have begun to use different MIME types for this
   format.  This RFC documents the format of comma separated values
   (CSV) files and formally registers the "text/csv" MIME type for CSV
   in accordance with RFC 2048 [1].

2.  Definition of the CSV Format

   While there are various specifications and implementations for the
   CSV format (for ex. [4], [5], [6] and [7]), there is no formal
   specification in existence, which allows for a wide variety of
   interpretations of CSV files.  This section documents the format that
   seems to be followed by most implementations:

   1.  Each record is located on a separate line, delimited by a line
       break (CRLF).  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF

   2.  The last record in the file may or may not have an ending line
       break.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   3.  There maybe an optional header line appearing as the first line
       of the file with the same format as normal record lines.  This
       header will contain names corresponding to the fields in the file
       and should contain the same number of fields as the records in
       the rest of the file (the presence or absence of the header line
       should be indicated via the optional "header" parameter of this
       MIME type).  For example:

       field_name,field_name,field_name CRLF
       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF






Shafranovich                 Informational                      [Page 2]

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


   4.  Within the header and each record, there may be one or more
       fields, separated by commas.  Each line should contain the same
       number of fields throughout the file.  Spaces are considered part
       of a field and should not be ignored.  The last field in the
       record must not be followed by a comma.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc

   5.  Each field may or may not be enclosed in double quotes (however
       some programs, such as Microsoft Excel, do not use double quotes
       at all).  If fields are not enclosed with double quotes, then
       double quotes may not appear inside the fields.  For example:

       "aaa","bbb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   6.  Fields containing line breaks (CRLF), double quotes, and commas
       should be enclosed in double-quotes.  For example:

       "aaa","b CRLF
       bb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   7.  If double-quotes are used to enclose fields, then a double-quote
       appearing inside a field must be escaped by preceding it with
       another double quote.  For example:

       "aaa","b""bb","ccc"

   The ABNF grammar [2] appears as follows:

   file = [header CRLF] record *(CRLF record) [CRLF]

   header = name *(COMMA name)

   record = field *(COMMA field)

   name = field

   field = (escaped / non-escaped)

   escaped = DQUOTE *(TEXTDATA / COMMA / CR / LF / 2DQUOTE) DQUOTE

   non-escaped = *TEXTDATA

   COMMA = %x2C

   CR = %x0D ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


   DQUOTE =  %x22 ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   LF = %x0A ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   CRLF = CR LF ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   TEXTDATA =  %x20-21 / %x23-2B / %x2D-7E

3.  MIME Type Registration of text/csv

   This section provides the media-type registration application (as per
   RFC 2048 [1].

   To: ietf-types@iana.org

   Subject: Registration of MIME media type text/csv

   MIME media type name: text

   MIME subtype name: csv

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: charset, header

      Common usage of CSV is US-ASCII, but other character sets defined
      by IANA for the "text" tree may be used in conjunction with the
      "charset" parameter.

      The "header" parameter indicates the presence or absence of the
      header line.  Valid values are "present" or "absent".
      Implementors choosing not to use this parameter must make their
      own decisions as to whether the header line is present or absent.

   Encoding considerations:

      As per section 4.1.1. of RFC 2046 [3], this media type uses CRLF
      to denote line breaks.  However, implementors should be aware that
      some implementations may use other values.

   Security considerations:

      CSV files contain passive text data that should not pose any
      risks.  However, it is possible in theory that malicious binary
      data may be included in order to exploit potential buffer overruns
      in the program processing CSV data.  Additionally, private data
      may be shared via this format (which of course applies to any text
      data).

   Interoperability considerations:

      Due to lack of a single specification, there are considerable
      differences among implementations.  Implementors should "be
      conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from
      others" (RFC 793 [8]) when processing CSV files.  An attempt at a
      common definition can be found in Section 2.

      Implementations deciding not to use the optional "header"
      parameter must make their own decision as to whether the header is
      absent or present.

   Published specification:

      While numerous private specifications exist for various programs
      and systems, there is no single "master" specification for this
      format.  An attempt at a common definition can be found in Section
      2.

Abstract

   STD 11, RFC 822, defines a message representation protocol specifying
   considerable detail about US-ASCII message headers, and leaves the
   message content, or message body, as flat US-ASCII text.  This set of
   documents, collectively called the Multipurpose Internet Mail
   Extensions, or MIME, redefines the format of messages to allow for

    (1)   textual message bodies in character sets other than
          US-ASCII,

    (2)   an extensible set of different formats for non-textual
          message bodies,

    (3)   multi-part message bodies, and

    (4)   textual header information in character sets other than
          US-ASCII.

   These documents are based on earlier work documented in RFC 934, STD
   11, and RFC 1049, but extends and revises them.  Because RFC 822 said
   so little about message bodies, these documents are largely
   orthogonal to (rather than a revision of) RFC 822.

RFC 2048              MIME Registration Procedures         November 1996


   This fourth document, RFC 2048, specifies various IANA registration
   procedures for the following MIME facilities:

    (1)   media types,

    (2)   external body access types,

    (3)   content-transfer-encodings.

   Registration of character sets for use in MIME is covered elsewhere
   and is no longer addressed by this document.

   These documents are revisions of RFCs 1521 and 1522, which themselves
   were revisions of RFCs 1341 and 1342.  An appendix in RFC 2049
   describes differences and changes from previous versions.

1.  Introduction

   Recent Internet protocols have been carefully designed to be easily
   extensible in certain areas.  In particular, MIME [RFC 2045] is an
   open-ended framework and can accommodate additional object types,
   character sets, and access methods without any changes to the basic
   protocol.  A registration process is needed, however, to ensure that
   the set of such values is developed in an orderly, well-specified,
   and public manner.

   This document defines registration procedures which use the Internet
   Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) as a central registry for such
   values.

   Historical Note: The registration process for media types was
   initially defined in the context of the asynchronous Internet mail
   environment.  In this mail environment there is a need to limit the
   number of possible media types to increase the likelihood of
   interoperability when the capabilities of the remote mail system are
   not known.  As media types are used in new environments, where the
   proliferation of media types is not a hindrance to interoperability,
   the original procedure was excessively restrictive and had to be
   generalized.





Freed, et. al.           Best Current Practice                  [Page 3]

RFC 2048              MIME Registration Procedures         November 1996


2.  Media Type Registration

   Registration of a new media type or types starts with the
   construction of a registration proposal.  Registration may occur in
   several different registration trees, which have different
   requirements as discussed below.  In general, the new registration
   proposal is circulated and reviewed in a fashion appropriate to the
   tree involved.  The media type is then registered if the proposal is
   acceptable.  The following sections describe the requirements and
   procedures used for each of the different registration trees.

2.1.  Registration Trees and Subtype Names

   In order to increase the efficiency and flexibility of the
   registration process, different structures of subtype names may be
   registered to accomodate the different natural requirements for,
   e.g., a subtype that will be recommended for wide support and
   implementation by the Internet Community or a subtype that is used to
   move files associated with proprietary software.  The following
   subsections define registration "trees", distinguished by the use of
   faceted names (e.g., names of the form "tree.subtree...type").  Note
   that some media types defined prior to this document do not conform
   to the naming conventions described below.  See Appendix A for a
   discussion of them.

2.1.1.  IETF Tree

   The IETF tree is intended for types of general interest to the
   Internet Community. Registration in the IETF tree requires approval
   by the IESG and publication of the media type registration as some
   form of RFC.

   Media types in the IETF tree are normally denoted by names that are
   not explicitly faceted, i.e., do not contain period (".", full stop)
   characters.

   The "owner" of a media type registration in the IETF tree is assumed
   to be the IETF itself.  Modification or alteration of the
   specification requires the same level of processing (e.g.  standards
   track) required for the initial registration.

2.1.2.  Vendor Tree

   The vendor tree is used for media types associated with commercially
   available products.  "Vendor" or "producer" are construed as
   equivalent and very broadly in this context.





Freed, et. al.           Best Current Practice                  [Page 4]

RFC 2048              MIME Registration Procedures         November 1996


   A registration may be placed in the vendor tree by anyone who has
   need to interchange files associated with the particular product.
   However, the registration formally belongs to the vendor or
   organization producing the software or file format.  Changes to the
   specification will be made at their request, as discussed in
   subsequent sections.

   Registrations in the vendor tree will be distinguished by the leading
   facet "vnd.".  That may be followed, at the discretion of the
   registration, by either a media type name from a well-known producer
   (e.g., "vnd.mudpie") or by an IANA-approved designation of the
   producer's name which is then followed by a media type or product
   designation (e.g., vnd.bigcompany.funnypictures).

   While public exposure and review of media types to be registered in
   the vendor tree is not required, using the ietf-types list for review
   is strongly encouraged to improve the quality of those
   specifications. Registrations in the vendor tree may be submitted
   directly to the IANA.

2.1.3.  Personal or Vanity Tree

   Registrations for media types created experimentally or as part of
   products that are not distributed commercially may be registered in
   the personal or vanity tree.  The registrations are distinguished by
   the leading facet "prs.".

   The owner of "personal" registrations and associated specifications
   is the person or entity making the registration, or one to whom
   responsibility has been transferred as described below.

   While public exposure and review of media types to be registered in
   the personal tree is not required, using the ietf-types list for
   review is strongly encouraged to improve the quality of those
   specifications.  Registrations in the personl tree may be submitted
   directly to the IANA.

2.1.4.  Special `x.' Tree

   For convenience and symmetry with this registration scheme, media
   type names with "x." as the first facet may be used for the same
   purposes for which names starting in "x-" are normally used.  These
   types are unregistered, experimental, and should be used only with
   the active agreement of the parties exchanging them.







Freed, et. al.           Best Current Practice                  [Page 5]

RFC 2048              MIME Registration Procedures         November 1996


   However, with the simplified registration procedures described above
   for vendor and personal trees, it should rarely, if ever, be
   necessary to use unregistered experimental types, and as such use of
   both "x-" and "x." forms is discouraged.

2.1.5.  Additional Registration Trees

   From time to time and as required by the community, the IANA may,
   with the advice and consent of the IESG, create new top-level
   registration trees.  It is explicitly assumed that these trees may be
   created for external registration and management by well-known
   permanent bodies, such as scientific societies for media types
   specific to the sciences they cover.  In general, the quality of
   review of specifications for one of these additional registration
   trees is expected to be equivalent to that which IETF would give to
   registrations in its own tree. Establishment of these new trees will
   be announced through RFC publication approved by the IESG.

2.2.  Registration Requirements

   Media type registration proposals are all expected to conform to
   various requirements laid out in the following sections.  Note that
   requirement specifics sometimes vary depending on the registration
   tree, again as detailed in the following sections.

2.2.1.  Functionality Requirement

   Media types must function as an actual media format: Registration of
   things that are better thought of as a transfer encoding, as a
   character set, or as a collection of separate entities of another
   type, is not allowed.  For example, although applications exist to
   decode the base64 transfer encoding [RFC 2045], base64 cannot be
   registered as a media type.

   This requirement applies regardless of the registration tree
   involved.

2.2.2.  Naming Requirements

   All registered media types must be assigned MIME type and subtype
   names. The combination of these names then serves to uniquely
   identify the media type and the format of the subtype name identifies
   the registration tree.

   The choice of top-level type name must take the nature of media type
   involved into account. For example, media normally used for
   representing still images should be a subtype of the image content
   type, whereas media capable of representing audio information belongs



Freed, et. al.           Best Current Practice                  [Page 6]

RFC 2048              MIME Registration Procedures         November 1996


   under the audio content type. See RFC 2046 for additional information
   on the basic set of top-level types and their characteristics.

   New subtypes of top-level types must conform to the restrictions of
   the top-level type, if any. For example, all subtypes of the
   multipart content type must use the same encapsulation syntax.

   In some cases a new media type may not "fit" under any currently
   defined top-level content type. Such cases are expected to be quite
   rare. However, if such a case arises a new top-level type can be
   defined to accommodate it. Such a definition must be done via
   standards-track RFC; no other mechanism can be used to define
   additional top-level content types.

   These requirements apply regardless of the registration tree
   involved.

2.2.3.  Parameter Requirements

   Media types may elect to use one or more MIME content type
   parameters, or some parameters may be automatically made available to
   the media type by virtue of being a subtype of a content type that
   defines a set of parameters applicable to any of its subtypes.  In
   either case, the names, values, and meanings of any parameters must
   be fully specified when a media type is registered in the IETF tree,
   and should be specified as completely as possible when media types
   are registered in the vendor or personal trees.

   New parameters must not be defined as a way to introduce new
   functionality in types registered in the IETF tree, although new
   parameters may be added to convey additional information that does
   not otherwise change existing functionality.  An example of this
   would be a "revision" parameter to indicate a revision level of an
   external specification such as JPEG.  Similar behavior is encouraged
   for media types registered in the vendor or personal trees but is not
   required.

2.2.4.  Canonicalization and Format Requirements

   All registered media types must employ a single, canonical data
   format, regardless of registration tree.

   A precise and openly available specification of the format of each
   media type is required for all types registered in the IETF tree and
   must at a minimum be referenced by, if it isn't actually included in,
   the media type registration proposal itself.





Freed, et. al.           Best Current Practice                  [Page 7]

RFC 2048              MIME Registration Procedures         November 1996


   The specifications of format and processing particulars may or may
   not be publically available for media types registered in the vendor
   tree, and such registration proposals are explicitly permitted to
   include only a specification of which software and version produce or
   process such media types.  References to or inclusion of format
   specifications in registration proposals is encouraged but not
   required.

   Format specifications are still required for registration in the
   personal tree, but may be either published as RFCs or otherwise
   deposited with IANA. The deposited specifications will meet the same
   criteria as those required to register a well-known TCP port and, in
   particular, need not be made public.

   Some media types involve the use of patented technology.  The
   registration of media types involving patented technology is
   specifically permitted.  However, the restrictions set forth in RFC
   1602 on the use of patented technology in standards-track protocols
   must be respected when the specification of a media type is part of a
   standards-track protocol.

2.2.5.  Interchange Recommendations

   Media types should, whenever possible, interoperate across as many
   systems and applications as possible. However, some media types will
   inevitably have problems interoperating across different platforms.
   Problems with different versions, byte ordering, and specifics of
   gateway handling can and will arise.

   Universal interoperability of media types is not required, but known
   interoperability issues should be identified whenever possible.
   Publication of a media type does not require an exhaustive review of
   interoperability, and the interoperability considerations section is
   subject to continuing evaluation.

   These recommendations apply regardless of the registration tree
   involved.

2.2.6.  Security Requirements

   An analysis of security issues is required for for all types
   registered in the IETF Tree.  (This is in accordance with the basic
   requirements for all IETF protocols.) A similar analysis for media
   types registered in the vendor or personal trees is encouraged but
   not required.  However, regardless of what security analysis has or
   has not been done, all descriptions of security issues must be as
   accurate as possible regardless of registration tree.  In particular,
   a statement that there are "no security issues associated with this



Freed, et. al.           Best Current Practice                  [Page 8]

RFC 2048              MIME Registration Procedures         November 1996


   type" must not be confused with "the security issues associates with
   this type have not been assessed".

   There is absolutely no requirement that media types registered in any
   tree be secure or completely free from risks.  Nevertheless, all
   known security risks must be identified in the registration of a
   media type, again regardless of registration tree.

   The security considerations section of all registrations is subject
   to continuing evaluation and modification, and in particular may be
   extended by use of the "comments on media types" mechanism described
   in subsequent sections.

   Some of the issues that should be looked at in a security analysis of
   a media type are:

    (1)   Complex media types may include provisions for
          directives that institute actions on a recipient's
          files or other resources.  In many cases provision is
          made for originators to specify arbitrary actions in an
          unrestricted fashion which may then have devastating
          effects.  See the registration of the
          application/postscript media type in RFC 2046 for
          an example of such directives and how to handle them.

    (2)   Complex media types may include provisions for
          directives that institute actions which, while not
          directly harmful to the recipient, may result in
          disclosure of information that either facilitates a
          subsequent attack or else violates a recipient's
          privacy in some way.  Again, the registration of the
          application/postscript media type illustrates how such
          directives can be handled.

    (3)   A media type might be targeted for applications that
          require some sort of security assurance but not provide
          the necessary security mechanisms themselves. For
          example, a media type could be defined for storage of
          confidential medical information which in turn requires
          an external confidentiality service.

2.2.7.  Usage and Implementation Non-requirements

   In the asynchronous mail environment, where information on the
   capabilities of the remote mail agent is frequently not available to
   the sender, maximum interoperability is attained by restricting the
   number of media types used to those "common" formats expected to be
   widely implemented.  This was asserted in the past as a reason to



Freed, et. al.           Best Current Practice                  [Page 9]

RFC 2048              MIME Registration Procedures         November 1996


   limit the number of possible media types and resulted in a
   registration process with a significant hurdle and delay for those
   registering media types.

   However, the need for "common" media types does not require limiting
   the registration of new media types. If a limited set of media types
   is recommended for a particular application, that should be asserted
   by a separate applicability statement specific for the application
   and/or environment.

   As such, universal support and implementation of a media type is NOT
   a requirement for registration.  If, however, a media type is
   explicitly intended for limited use, this should be noted in its
   registration.

2.2.8.  Publication Requirements

   Proposals for media types registered in the IETF tree must be
   published as RFCs. RFC publication of vendor and personal media type
   proposals is encouraged but not required. In all cases IANA will
   retain copies of all media type proposals and "publish" them as part
   of the media types registration tree itself.

   Other than in the IETF tree, the registration of a data type does not
   imply endorsement, approval, or recommendation by IANA or IETF or
   even certification that the specification is adequate.  To become
   Internet Standards, protocol, data objects, or whatever must go
   through the IETF standards process.  This is too difficult and too
   lengthy a process for the convenient registration of media types.

   The IETF tree exists for media types that do require require a
   substantive review and approval process with the vendor and personal
   trees exist for those that do not. It is expected that applicability
   statements for particular applications will be published from time to
   time that recommend implementation of, and support for, media types
   that have proven particularly useful in those contexts.

   As discussed above, registration of a top-level type requires
   standards-track processing and, hence, RFC publication.

2.2.9.  Additional Information

   Various sorts of optional information may be included in the
   specification of a media type if it is available:

    (1)   Magic number(s) (length, octet values). Magic numbers
          are byte sequences that are always present and thus can
          be used to identify entities as being of a given media



Freed, et. al.           Best Current Practice                 [Page 10]

RFC 2048              MIME Registration Procedures         November 1996


          type.

    (2)   File extension(s) commonly used on one or more
          platforms to indicate that some file containing a given
          type of media.

    (3)   Macintosh File Type code(s) (4 octets) used to label
          files containing a given type of media.

   Such information is often quite useful to implementors and if
   available should be provided.

2.3.  Registration Procedure

   The following procedure has been implemented by the IANA for review
   and approval of new media types.  This is not a formal standards
   process, but rather an administrative procedure intended to allow
   community comment and sanity checking without excessive time delay.
   For registration in the IETF tree, the normal IETF processes should
   be followed, treating posting of an internet-draft and announcement
   on the ietf-types list (as described in the next subsection) as a
   first step.  For registrations in the vendor or personal tree, the
   initial review step described below may be omitted and the type
   registered directly by submitting the template and an explanation
   directly to IANA (at iana@iana.org).  However, authors of vendor or
   personal media type specifications are encouraged to seek community
   review and comment whenever that is feasible.

2.3.1.  Present the Media Type to the Community for Review

   Send a proposed media type registration to the "ietf-types@iana.org"
   mailing list for a two week review period.  This mailing list has
   been established for the purpose of reviewing proposed media and
   access types. Proposed media types are not formally registered and
   must not be used; the "x-" prefix specified in RFC 2045 can be used
   until registration is complete.

   The intent of the public posting is to solicit comments and feedback
   on the choice of type/subtype name, the unambiguity of the references
   with respect to versions and external profiling information, and a
   review of any interoperability or security considerations. The
   submitter may submit a revised registration, or withdraw the
   registration completely, at any time.








Freed, et. al.           Best Current Practice                 [Page 11]

RFC 2048              MIME Registration Procedures         November 1996


2.3.2.  IESG Approval

   Media types registered in the IETF tree must be submitted to the IESG
   for approval.

2.3.3.  IANA Registration

   Provided that the media type meets the requirements for media types
   and has obtained approval that is necessary, the author may submit
   the registration request to the IANA, which will register the media
   type and make the media type registration available to the community.

2.4.  Comments on Media Type Registrations

   Comments on registered media types may be submitted by members of the
   community to IANA.  These comments will be passed on to the "owner"
   of the media type if possible.  Submitters of comments may request
   that their comment be attached to the media type registration itself,
   and if IANA approves of this the comment will be made accessible in
   conjunction with the type registration itself.

2.5.  Location of Registered Media Type List

   Media type registrations will be posted in the anonymous FTP
   directory "ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/media-types/"
   and all registered media types will be listed in the periodically
   issued "Assigned Numbers" RFC [currently STD 2, RFC 1700].  The media
   type description and other supporting material may also be published
   as an Informational RFC by sending it to "rfc-editor@isi.edu" (please
   follow the instructions to RFC authors [RFC-1543]).

2.6.  IANA Procedures for Registering Media Types

   The IANA will only register media types in the IETF tree in response
   to a communication from the IESG stating that a given registration
   has been approved. Vendor and personal types will be registered by
   the IANA automatically and without any formal review as long as the
   following minimal conditions are met:

    (1)   Media types must function as an actual media format.
          In particular, character sets and transfer encodings
          may not be registered as media types.

    (2)   All media types must have properly formed type and
          subtype names. All type names must be defined by a
          standards-track RFC. All subtype names must be unique,
          must conform to the MIME grammar for such names, and
          must contain the proper tree prefix.



Freed, et. al.           Best Current Practice                 [Page 12]

RFC 2048              MIME Registration Procedures         November 1996


    (3)   Types registered in the personal tree must either
          provide a format specification or a pointer to one.

    (4)   Any security considerations given must not be obviously
          bogus. (It is neither possible nor necessary for the
          IANA to conduct a comprehensive security review of
          media type registrations.  Nevertheless, IANA has the
          authority to identify obviously incompetent material
          and exclude it.)

2.7.  Change Control

   Once a media type has been published by IANA, the author may request
   a change to its definition. The descriptions of the different
   registration trees above designate the "owners" of each type of
   registration. The change request follows the same procedure as the
   registration request:

    (1)   Publish the revised template on the ietf-types list.

    (2)   Leave at least two weeks for comments.

    (3)   Publish using IANA after formal review if required.

   Changes should be requested only when there are serious omission or
   errors in the published specification. When review is required, a
   change request may be denied if it renders entities that were valid
   under the previous definition invalid under the new definition.

   The owner of a content type may pass responsibility for the content
   type to another person or agency by informing IANA and the ietf-types
   list; this can be done without discussion or review.

   The IESG may reassign responsibility for a media type. The most
   common case of this will be to enable changes to be made to types
   where the author of the registration has died, moved out of contact
   or is otherwise unable to make changes that are important to the
   community.

   Media type registrations may not be deleted; media types which are no
   longer believed appropriate for use can be declared OBSOLETE by a
   change to their "intended use" field; such media types will be
   clearly marked in the lists published by IANA.

3.  External Body Access Types

   RFC 2046 defines the message/external-body media type, whereby a MIME
   entity can act as pointer to the actual body data in lieu of
   including the data directly in the entity body. Each
   message/external-body reference specifies an access type, which
   determines the mechanism used to retrieve the actual body data. RFC
   2046 defines an initial set of access types, but allows for the

RFC 2048              MIME Registration Procedures         November 1996


   registration of additional access types to accommodate new retrieval
   mechanisms.

3.1.  Registration Requirements

   New access type specifications must conform to a number of
   requirements as described below.

3.1.1.  Naming Requirements

   Each access type must have a unique name.  This name appears in the
   access-type parameter in the message/external-body content-type
   header field, and must conform to MIME content type parameter syntax.

3.1.2.  Mechanism Specification Requirements

   All of the protocols, transports, and procedures used by a given
   access type must be described, either in the specification of the
   access type itself or in some other publicly available specification,
   in sufficient detail for the access type to be implemented by any
   competent implementor.  Use of secret and/or proprietary methods in
   access types are expressly prohibited. The restrictions imposed by
   RFC 1602 on the standardization of patented algorithms must be
   respected as well.

3.1.3.  Publication Requirements

   All access types must be described by an RFC. The RFC may be
   informational rather than standards-track, although standard-track
   review and approval are encouraged for all access types.

3.1.4.  Security Requirements

   Any known security issues that arise from the use of the access type
   must be completely and fully described. It is not required that the
   access type be secure or that it be free from risks, but that the
   known risks be identified.  Publication of a new access type does not
   require an exhaustive security review, and the security
   considerations section is subject to continuing evaluation.
   Additional security considerations should be addressed by publishing
   revised versions of the access type specification.

3.2.  Registration Procedure

   Registration of a new access type starts with the construction of a
   draft of an RFC.





Freed, et. al.           Best Current Practice                 [Page 15]

RFC 2048              MIME Registration Procedures         November 1996


3.2.1.  Present the Access Type to the Community

   Send a proposed access type specification to the "ietf-
   types@iana.org" mailing list for a two week review period.  This
   mailing list has been established for the purpose of reviewing
   proposed access and media types.  Proposed access types are not
   formally registered and must not be used.

   The intent of the public posting is to solicit comments and feedback
   on the access type specification and a review of any security
   considerations.

3.2.2.  Access Type Reviewer

   When the two week period has passed, the access type reviewer, who is
   appointed by the IETF Applications Area Director, either forwards the
   request to iana@isi.edu, or rejects it because of significant
   objections raised on the list.

   Decisions made by the reviewer must be posted to the ietf-types
   mailing list within 14 days. Decisions made by the reviewer may be
   appealed to the IESG.

3.2.3.  IANA Registration

   Provided that the access type has either passed review or has been
   successfully appealed to the IESG, the IANA will register the access
   type and make the registration available to the community. The
   specification of the access type must also be published as an RFC.
   Informational RFCs are published by sending them to "rfc-
   editor@isi.edu" (please follow the instructions to RFC authors [RFC-
   1543]).

3.3.  Location of Registered Access Type List

   Access type registrations will be posted in the anonymous FTP
   directory "ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/access-types/"
   and all registered access types will be listed in the periodically
   issued "Assigned Numbers" RFC [currently RFC-1700].

3.4.  IANA Procedures for Registering Access Types

   The identity of the access type reviewer is communicated to the IANA
   by the IESG.  The IANA then only acts in response to access type
   definitions that either are approved by the access type reviewer and
   forwarded by the reviewer to the IANA for registration, or in
   response to a communication from the IESG that an access type
   definition appeal has overturned the access type reviewer's ruling.

4.  Transfer Encodings

   Transfer encodings are tranformations applied to MIME media types
   after conversion to the media type's canonical form.  Transfer
   encodings are used for several purposes:

    (1)   Many transports, especially message transports, can
          only handle data consisting of relatively short lines
          of text. There can also be severe restrictions on what
          characters can be used in these lines of text -- some
          transports are restricted to a small subset of US-ASCII
          and others cannot handle certain character sequences.
          Transfer encodings are used to transform binary data
          into textual form that can survive such transports.
          Examples of this sort of transfer encoding include the
          base64 and quoted-printable transfer encodings defined
          in RFC 2045.

    (2)   Image, audio, video, and even application entities are
          sometimes quite large. Compression algorithms are often
          quite effective in reducing the size of large entities.
          Transfer encodings can be used to apply general-purpose
          non-lossy compression algorithms to MIME entities.

    (3)   Transport encodings can be defined as a means of
          representing existing encoding formats in a MIME
          context.

   IMPORTANT:  The standardization of a large numbers of different
   transfer encodings is seen as a significant barrier to widespread
   interoperability and is expressely discouraged.  Nevertheless, the
   following procedure has been defined to provide a means of defining
   additional transfer encodings, should standardization actually be
   justified.

4.1.  Transfer Encoding Requirements

   Transfer encoding specifications must conform to a number of
   requirements as described below.

4.1.1.  Naming Requirements

   Each transfer encoding must have a unique name.  This name appears in
   the Content-Transfer-Encoding header field and must conform to the
   syntax of that field.






Freed, et. al.           Best Current Practice                 [Page 17]

RFC 2048              MIME Registration Procedures         November 1996


4.1.2.  Algorithm Specification Requirements

   All of the algorithms used in a transfer encoding (e.g.  conversion
   to printable form, compression) must be described in their entirety
   in the transfer encoding specification.  Use of secret and/or
   proprietary algorithms in standardized transfer encodings are
   expressly prohibited. The restrictions imposed by RFC 1602 on the
   standardization of patented algorithms must be respected as well.

4.1.3.  Input Domain Requirements

   All transfer encodings must be applicable to an arbitrary sequence of
   octets of any length.  Dependence on particular input forms is not
   allowed.

   It should be noted that the 7bit and 8bit encodings do not conform to
   this requirement. Aside from the undesireability of having
   specialized encodings, the intent here is to forbid the addition of
   additional encodings along the lines of 7bit and 8bit.

4.1.4.  Output Range Requirements

   There is no requirement that a particular tranfer encoding produce a
   particular form of encoded output.  However, the output format for
   each transfer encoding must be fully and completely documented.  In
   particular, each specification must clearly state whether the output
   format always lies within the confines of 7bit data, 8bit data, or is
   simply pure binary data.

4.1.5.  Data Integrity and Generality Requirements

   All transfer encodings must be fully invertible on any platform; it
   must be possible for anyone to recover the original data by
   performing the corresponding decoding operation.  Note that this
   requirement effectively excludes all forms of lossy compression as
   well as all forms of encryption from use as a transfer encoding.

4.1.6.  New Functionality Requirements

   All transfer encodings must provide some sort of new functionality.
   Some degree of functionality overlap with previously defined transfer
   encodings is acceptable, but any new transfer encoding must also
   offer something no other transfer encoding provides.








Freed, et. al.           Best Current Practice                 [Page 18]

RFC 2048              MIME Registration Procedures         November 1996


4.2.  Transfer Encoding Definition Procedure

   Definition of a new transfer encoding starts with the construction of
   a draft of a standards-track RFC.  The RFC must define the transfer
   encoding precisely and completely, and must also provide substantial
   justification for defining and standardizing a new transfer encoding.
   This specification must then be presented to the IESG for
   consideration.  The IESG can

    (1)   reject the specification outright as being
          inappropriate for standardization,

    (2)   approve the formation of an IETF working group to work
          on the specification in accordance with IETF
          procedures, or,

    (3)   accept the specification as-is and put it directly on
          the standards track.

   Transfer encoding specifications on the standards track follow normal
   IETF rules for standards track documents.  A transfer encoding is
   considered to be defined and available for use once it is on the
   standards track.

4.3.  IANA Procedures for Transfer Encoding Registration

   There is no need for a special procedure for registering Transfer
   Encodings with the IANA. All legitimate transfer encoding
   registrations must appear as a standards-track RFC, so it is the
   IESG's responsibility to notify the IANA when a new transfer encoding
   has been approved.

4.4.  Location of Registered Transfer Encodings List

   Transfer encoding registrations will be posted in the anonymous FTP
   directory "ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/transfer-
   encodings/" and all registered transfer encodings will be listed in
   the periodically issued "Assigned Numbers" RFC [currently RFC-1700].

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


1.  Introduction

   The comma separated values format (CSV) has been used for exchanging
   and converting data between various spreadsheet programs for quite
   some time.  Surprisingly, while this format is very common, it has
   never been formally documented.  Additionally, while the IANA MIME
   registration tree includes a registration for
   "text/tab-separated-values" type, no MIME types have ever been
   registered with IANA for CSV.  At the same time, various programs and
   operating systems have begun to use different MIME types for this
   format.  This RFC documents the format of comma separated values
   (CSV) files and formally registers the "text/csv" MIME type for CSV
   in accordance with RFC 2048 [1].

2.  Definition of the CSV Format

   While there are various specifications and implementations for the
   CSV format (for ex. [4], [5], [6] and [7]), there is no formal
   specification in existence, which allows for a wide variety of
   interpretations of CSV files.  This section documents the format that
   seems to be followed by most implementations:

   1.  Each record is located on a separate line, delimited by a line
       break (CRLF).  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF

   2.  The last record in the file may or may not have an ending line
       break.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   3.  There maybe an optional header line appearing as the first line
       of the file with the same format as normal record lines.  This
       header will contain names corresponding to the fields in the file
       and should contain the same number of fields as the records in
       the rest of the file (the presence or absence of the header line
       should be indicated via the optional "header" parameter of this
       MIME type).  For example:

       field_name,field_name,field_name CRLF
       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF






Shafranovich                 Informational                      [Page 2]

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


   4.  Within the header and each record, there may be one or more
       fields, separated by commas.  Each line should contain the same
       number of fields throughout the file.  Spaces are considered part
       of a field and should not be ignored.  The last field in the
       record must not be followed by a comma.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc

   5.  Each field may or may not be enclosed in double quotes (however
       some programs, such as Microsoft Excel, do not use double quotes
       at all).  If fields are not enclosed with double quotes, then
       double quotes may not appear inside the fields.  For example:

       "aaa","bbb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   6.  Fields containing line breaks (CRLF), double quotes, and commas
       should be enclosed in double-quotes.  For example:

       "aaa","b CRLF
       bb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   7.  If double-quotes are used to enclose fields, then a double-quote
       appearing inside a field must be escaped by preceding it with
       another double quote.  For example:

       "aaa","b""bb","ccc"

   The ABNF grammar [2] appears as follows:

   file = [header CRLF] record *(CRLF record) [CRLF]

   header = name *(COMMA name)

   record = field *(COMMA field)

   name = field

   field = (escaped / non-escaped)

   escaped = DQUOTE *(TEXTDATA / COMMA / CR / LF / 2DQUOTE) DQUOTE

   non-escaped = *TEXTDATA

   COMMA = %x2C

   CR = %x0D ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


   DQUOTE =  %x22 ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   LF = %x0A ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   CRLF = CR LF ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   TEXTDATA =  %x20-21 / %x23-2B / %x2D-7E

3.  MIME Type Registration of text/csv

   This section provides the media-type registration application (as per
   RFC 2048 [1].

   To: ietf-types@iana.org

   Subject: Registration of MIME media type text/csv

   MIME media type name: text

   MIME subtype name: csv

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: charset, header

      Common usage of CSV is US-ASCII, but other character sets defined
      by IANA for the "text" tree may be used in conjunction with the
      "charset" parameter.

      The "header" parameter indicates the presence or absence of the
      header line.  Valid values are "present" or "absent".
      Implementors choosing not to use this parameter must make their
      own decisions as to whether the header line is present or absent.

   Encoding considerations:

      As per section 4.1.1. of RFC 2046 [3], this media type uses CRLF
      to denote line breaks.  However, implementors should be aware that
      some implementations may use other values.

   Security considerations:

      CSV files contain passive text data that should not pose any
      risks.  However, it is possible in theory that malicious binary
      data may be included in order to exploit potential buffer overruns
      in the program processing CSV data.  Additionally, private data
      may be shared via this format (which of course applies to any text
      data).

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


   Interoperability considerations:

      Due to lack of a single specification, there are considerable
      differences among implementations.  Implementors should "be
      conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from
      others" (RFC 793 [8]) when processing CSV files.  An attempt at a
      common definition can be found in Section 2.

      Implementations deciding not to use the optional "header"
      parameter must make their own decision as to whether the header is
      absent or present.

   Published specification:

      While numerous private specifications exist for various programs
      and systems, there is no single "master" specification for this
      format.  An attempt at a common definition can be found in Section
      2.

   Applications that use this media type:

      Spreadsheet programs and various data conversion utilities

   Additional information:

      Magic number(s): none

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


1.  Introduction

   The comma separated values format (CSV) has been used for exchanging
   and converting data between various spreadsheet programs for quite
   some time.  Surprisingly, while this format is very common, it has
   never been formally documented.  Additionally, while the IANA MIME
   registration tree includes a registration for
   "text/tab-separated-values" type, no MIME types have ever been
   registered with IANA for CSV.  At the same time, various programs and
   operating systems have begun to use different MIME types for this
   format.  This RFC documents the format of comma separated values
   (CSV) files and formally registers the "text/csv" MIME type for CSV
   in accordance with RFC 2048 [1].

2.  Definition of the CSV Format

   While there are various specifications and implementations for the
   CSV format (for ex. [4], [5], [6] and [7]), there is no formal
   specification in existence, which allows for a wide variety of
   interpretations of CSV files.  This section documents the format that
   seems to be followed by most implementations:

   1.  Each record is located on a separate line, delimited by a line
       break (CRLF).  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF

   2.  The last record in the file may or may not have an ending line
       break.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   3.  There maybe an optional header line appearing as the first line
       of the file with the same format as normal record lines.  This
       header will contain names corresponding to the fields in the file
       and should contain the same number of fields as the records in
       the rest of the file (the presence or absence of the header line
       should be indicated via the optional "header" parameter of this
       MIME type).  For example:

       field_name,field_name,field_name CRLF
       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF






Shafranovich                 Informational                      [Page 2]

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


   4.  Within the header and each record, there may be one or more
       fields, separated by commas.  Each line should contain the same
       number of fields throughout the file.  Spaces are considered part
       of a field and should not be ignored.  The last field in the
       record must not be followed by a comma.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc

   5.  Each field may or may not be enclosed in double quotes (however
       some programs, such as Microsoft Excel, do not use double quotes
       at all).  If fields are not enclosed with double quotes, then
       double quotes may not appear inside the fields.  For example:

       "aaa","bbb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   6.  Fields containing line breaks (CRLF), double quotes, and commas
       should be enclosed in double-quotes.  For example:

       "aaa","b CRLF
       bb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   7.  If double-quotes are used to enclose fields, then a double-quote
       appearing inside a field must be escaped by preceding it with
       another double quote.  For example:

       "aaa","b""bb","ccc"

   The ABNF grammar [2] appears as follows:

   file = [header CRLF] record *(CRLF record) [CRLF]

   header = name *(COMMA name)

   record = field *(COMMA field)

   name = field

   field = (escaped / non-escaped)

   escaped = DQUOTE *(TEXTDATA / COMMA / CR / LF / 2DQUOTE) DQUOTE

   non-escaped = *TEXTDATA

   COMMA = %x2C

   CR = %x0D ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


   DQUOTE =  %x22 ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   LF = %x0A ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   CRLF = CR LF ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   TEXTDATA =  %x20-21 / %x23-2B / %x2D-7E

3.  MIME Type Registration of text/csv

   This section provides the media-type registration application (as per
   RFC 2048 [1].

   To: ietf-types@iana.org

   Subject: Registration of MIME media type text/csv

   MIME media type name: text

   MIME subtype name: csv

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: charset, header

      Common usage of CSV is US-ASCII, but other character sets defined
      by IANA for the "text" tree may be used in conjunction with the
      "charset" parameter.

      The "header" parameter indicates the presence or absence of the
      header line.  Valid values are "present" or "absent".
      Implementors choosing not to use this parameter must make their
      own decisions as to whether the header line is present or absent.

   Encoding considerations:

      As per section 4.1.1. of RFC 2046 [3], this media type uses CRLF
      to denote line breaks.  However, implementors should be aware that
      some implementations may use other values.

   Security considerations:

      CSV files contain passive text data that should not pose any
      risks.  However, it is possible in theory that malicious binary
      data may be included in order to exploit potential buffer overruns
      in the program processing CSV data.  Additionally, private data
      may be shared via this format (which of course applies to any text
      data).

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


   Interoperability considerations:

      Due to lack of a single specification, there are considerable
      differences among implementations.  Implementors should "be
      conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from
      others" (RFC 793 [8]) when processing CSV files.  An attempt at a
      common definition can be found in Section 2.

      Implementations deciding not to use the optional "header"
      parameter must make their own decision as to whether the header is
      absent or present.

   Published specification:

      While numerous private specifications exist for various programs
      and systems, there is no single "master" specification for this
      format.  An attempt at a common definition can be found in Section
      2.

   Applications that use this media type:

      Spreadsheet programs and various data conversion utilities

   The comma separated values format (CSV) has been used for exchanging

   some time.  Surprisingly, while this format is very common, it has
   never been formally documented.  Additionally, while the IANA MIME

2.  Definition of the CSV Format

   While there are various specifications and implementations for the
   CSV format (for ex. [4], [5], [6] and [7]), there is no formal
   specification in existence, which allows for a wide variety of
   interpretations of CSV files.  This section documents the format that

   4.  Within the header and each record, there may be one or more
       fields, separated by commas.  Each line should contain the same
       number of fields throughout the file.  Spaces are considered part
       of a field and should not be ignored.  The last field in the
       record must not be followed by a comma.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc

   5.  Each field may or may not be enclosed in double quotes (however
       some programs, such as Microsoft Excel, do not use double quotes
       at all).  If fields are not enclosed with double quotes, then
       double quotes may not appear inside the fields.  For example:

       "aaa","bbb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   6.  Fields containing line breaks (CRLF), double quotes, and commas
       should be enclosed in double-quotes.  For example:

       "aaa","b CRLF
       bb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   7.  If double-quotes are used to enclose fields, then a double-quote
       appearing inside a field must be escaped by preceding it with
       another double quote.  For example:

       "aaa","b""bb","ccc"

   The ABNF grammar [2] appears as follows:

   file = [header CRLF] record *(CRLF record) [CRLF]

   header = name *(COMMA name)

   record = field *(COMMA field)

   name = field

   field = (escaped / non-escaped)

   escaped = DQUOTE *(TEXTDATA / COMMA / CR / LF / 2DQUOTE) DQUOTE

   non-escaped = *TEXTDATA

   COMMA = %x2C

   CR = %x0D ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

      data may be included in order to exploit potential buffer overruns
      in the program processing CSV data.  Additionally, private data

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


1.  Introduction

   The comma separated values format (CSV) has been used for exchanging
   and converting data between various spreadsheet programs for quite
   some time.  Surprisingly, while this format is very common, it has
   never been formally documented.  Additionally, while the IANA MIME
   registration tree includes a registration for
   "text/tab-separated-values" type, no MIME types have ever been
   registered with IANA for CSV.  At the same time, various programs and
   operating systems have begun to use different MIME types for this
   format.  This RFC documents the format of comma separated values
   (CSV) files and formally registers the "text/csv" MIME type for CSV
   in accordance with RFC 2048 [1].

2.  Definition of the CSV Format

   While there are various specifications and implementations for the
   CSV format (for ex. [4], [5], [6] and [7]), there is no formal
   specification in existence, which allows for a wide variety of
   interpretations of CSV files.  This section documents the format that
   seems to be followed by most implementations:

   1.  Each record is located on a separate line, delimited by a line
       break (CRLF).  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF

   2.  The last record in the file may or may not have an ending line
       break.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   3.  There maybe an optional header line appearing as the first line
       of the file with the same format as normal record lines.  This
       header will contain names corresponding to the fields in the file
       and should contain the same number of fields as the records in
       the rest of the file (the presence or absence of the header line
       should be indicated via the optional "header" parameter of this
       MIME type).  For example:

       field_name,field_name,field_name CRLF
       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF






Shafranovich                 Informational                      [Page 2]

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


   4.  Within the header and each record, there may be one or more
       fields, separated by commas.  Each line should contain the same
       number of fields throughout the file.  Spaces are considered part
       of a field and should not be ignored.  The last field in the
       record must not be followed by a comma.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc

   5.  Each field may or may not be enclosed in double quotes (however
       some programs, such as Microsoft Excel, do not use double quotes
       at all).  If fields are not enclosed with double quotes, then
       double quotes may not appear inside the fields.  For example:

       "aaa","bbb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   6.  Fields containing line breaks (CRLF), double quotes, and commas
       should be enclosed in double-quotes.  For example:

       "aaa","b CRLF
       bb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   7.  If double-quotes are used to enclose fields, then a double-quote
       appearing inside a field must be escaped by preceding it with
       another double quote.  For example:

       "aaa","b""bb","ccc"

   The ABNF grammar [2] appears as follows:

   file = [header CRLF] record *(CRLF record) [CRLF]

   header = name *(COMMA name)

   record = field *(COMMA field)

   name = field

   field = (escaped / non-escaped)

   escaped = DQUOTE *(TEXTDATA / COMMA / CR / LF / 2DQUOTE) DQUOTE

   non-escaped = *TEXTDATA

   COMMA = %x2C

   CR = %x0D ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


   DQUOTE =  %x22 ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   LF = %x0A ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   CRLF = CR LF ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   TEXTDATA =  %x20-21 / %x23-2B / %x2D-7E

3.  MIME Type Registration of text/csv

   This section provides the media-type registration application (as per
   RFC 2048 [1].

   To: ietf-types@iana.org

   Subject: Registration of MIME media type text/csv

   MIME media type name: text

   MIME subtype name: csv

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: charset, header

      Common usage of CSV is US-ASCII, but other character sets defined
      by IANA for the "text" tree may be used in conjunction with the
      "charset" parameter.

      The "header" parameter indicates the presence or absence of the
      header line.  Valid values are "present" or "absent".
      Implementors choosing not to use this parameter must make their
      own decisions as to whether the header line is present or absent.

   Encoding considerations:

      As per section 4.1.1. of RFC 2046 [3], this media type uses CRLF
      to denote line breaks.  However, implementors should be aware that
      some implementations may use other values.

   Security considerations:

      CSV files contain passive text data that should not pose any
      risks.  However, it is possible in theory that malicious binary
      data may be included in order to exploit potential buffer overruns
      in the program processing CSV data.  Additionally, private data
      may be shared via this format (which of course applies to any text
      data).

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


   Interoperability considerations:

      Due to lack of a single specification, there are considerable
      differences among implementations.  Implementors should "be
      conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from
      others" (RFC 793 [8]) when processing CSV files.  An attempt at a
      common definition can be found in Section 2.

      Implementations deciding not to use the optional "header"
      parameter must make their own decision as to whether the header is
      absent or present.

   Published specification:

      While numerous private specifications exist for various programs
      and systems, there is no single "master" specification for this
      format.  An attempt at a common definition can be found in Section
      2.

   Applications that use this media type:

      Spreadsheet programs and various data conversion utilities

      Magic number(s): none

      File extension(s): CSV

   The comma separated values format (CSV) has been used for exchanging

   never been formally documented.  Additionally, while the IANA MIME

2.  Definition of the CSV Format

   While there are various specifications and implementations for the
   CSV format (for ex. [4], [5], [6] and [7]), there is no formal
   specification in existence, which allows for a wide variety of
   interpretations of CSV files.  This section documents the format that

       should be indicated via the optional "header" parameter of this
       MIME type).  For example:

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


   4.  Within the header and each record, there may be one or more
       fields, separated by commas.  Each line should contain the same
       number of fields throughout the file.  Spaces are considered part
       of a field and should not be ignored.  The last field in the
       record must not be followed by a comma.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc

   5.  Each field may or may not be enclosed in double quotes (however
       some programs, such as Microsoft Excel, do not use double quotes
       at all).  If fields are not enclosed with double quotes, then
       double quotes may not appear inside the fields.  For example:

       "aaa","bbb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   6.  Fields containing line breaks (CRLF), double quotes, and commas
       should be enclosed in double-quotes.  For example:

       "aaa","b CRLF
       bb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   7.  If double-quotes are used to enclose fields, then a double-quote
       appearing inside a field must be escaped by preceding it with
       another double quote.  For example:

       "aaa","b""bb","ccc"

   The ABNF grammar [2] appears as follows:

   file = [header CRLF] record *(CRLF record) [CRLF]

   header = name *(COMMA name)

   record = field *(COMMA field)

   name = field

   field = (escaped / non-escaped)

   escaped = DQUOTE *(TEXTDATA / COMMA / CR / LF / 2DQUOTE) DQUOTE

   non-escaped = *TEXTDATA

   COMMA = %x2C

   CR = %x0D ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

3.  MIME Type Registration of text/csv

   This section provides the media-type registration application (as per
   RFC 2048 [1].

   To: ietf-types@iana.org

   Subject: Registration of MIME media type text/csv

   MIME media type name: text

   MIME subtype name: csv

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: charset, header

      Common usage of CSV is US-ASCII, but other character sets defined
      by IANA for the "text" tree may be used in conjunction with the
      "charset" parameter.

      The "header" parameter indicates the presence or absence of the
      header line.  Valid values are "present" or "absent".
      Implementors choosing not to use this parameter must make their
      own decisions as to whether the header line is present or absent.

   Encoding considerations:

      As per section 4.1.1. of RFC 2046 [3], this media type uses CRLF
      to denote line breaks.  However, implementors should be aware that
      some implementations may use other values.

   Security considerations:

      CSV files contain passive text data that should not pose any
      risks.  However, it is possible in theory that malicious binary
      data may be included in order to exploit potential buffer overruns
      in the program processing CSV data.  Additionally, private data
      may be shared via this format (which of course applies to any text
      data).

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


1.  Introduction

   The comma separated values format (CSV) has been used for exchanging
   and converting data between various spreadsheet programs for quite
   some time.  Surprisingly, while this format is very common, it has
   never been formally documented.  Additionally, while the IANA MIME
   registration tree includes a registration for
   "text/tab-separated-values" type, no MIME types have ever been
   registered with IANA for CSV.  At the same time, various programs and
   operating systems have begun to use different MIME types for this
   format.  This RFC documents the format of comma separated values
   (CSV) files and formally registers the "text/csv" MIME type for CSV
   in accordance with RFC 2048 [1].

2.  Definition of the CSV Format

   While there are various specifications and implementations for the
   CSV format (for ex. [4], [5], [6] and [7]), there is no formal
   specification in existence, which allows for a wide variety of
   interpretations of CSV files.  This section documents the format that
   seems to be followed by most implementations:

   1.  Each record is located on a separate line, delimited by a line
       break (CRLF).  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF

   2.  The last record in the file may or may not have an ending line
       break.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   3.  There maybe an optional header line appearing as the first line
       of the file with the same format as normal record lines.  This
       header will contain names corresponding to the fields in the file
       and should contain the same number of fields as the records in
       the rest of the file (the presence or absence of the header line
       should be indicated via the optional "header" parameter of this
       MIME type).  For example:

       field_name,field_name,field_name CRLF
       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF






Shafranovich                 Informational                      [Page 2]

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


   4.  Within the header and each record, there may be one or more
       fields, separated by commas.  Each line should contain the same
       number of fields throughout the file.  Spaces are considered part
       of a field and should not be ignored.  The last field in the
       record must not be followed by a comma.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc

   5.  Each field may or may not be enclosed in double quotes (however
       some programs, such as Microsoft Excel, do not use double quotes
       at all).  If fields are not enclosed with double quotes, then
       double quotes may not appear inside the fields.  For example:

       "aaa","bbb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   6.  Fields containing line breaks (CRLF), double quotes, and commas
       should be enclosed in double-quotes.  For example:

       "aaa","b CRLF
       bb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   7.  If double-quotes are used to enclose fields, then a double-quote
       appearing inside a field must be escaped by preceding it with
       another double quote.  For example:

       "aaa","b""bb","ccc"

   The ABNF grammar [2] appears as follows:

   file = [header CRLF] record *(CRLF record) [CRLF]

   header = name *(COMMA name)

   record = field *(COMMA field)

   name = field

   field = (escaped / non-escaped)

   escaped = DQUOTE *(TEXTDATA / COMMA / CR / LF / 2DQUOTE) DQUOTE

   non-escaped = *TEXTDATA

   COMMA = %x2C

   CR = %x0D ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


   DQUOTE =  %x22 ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   LF = %x0A ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   CRLF = CR LF ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   TEXTDATA =  %x20-21 / %x23-2B / %x2D-7E

3.  MIME Type Registration of text/csv

   This section provides the media-type registration application (as per
   RFC 2048 [1].

   To: ietf-types@iana.org

   Subject: Registration of MIME media type text/csv

   MIME media type name: text

   MIME subtype name: csv

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: charset, header

      Common usage of CSV is US-ASCII, but other character sets defined
      by IANA for the "text" tree may be used in conjunction with the
      "charset" parameter.

      The "header" parameter indicates the presence or absence of the
      header line.  Valid values are "present" or "absent".
      Implementors choosing not to use this parameter must make their
      own decisions as to whether the header line is present or absent.

   Encoding considerations:

      As per section 4.1.1. of RFC 2046 [3], this media type uses CRLF
      to denote line breaks.  However, implementors should be aware that
      some implementations may use other values.

   Security considerations:

      CSV files contain passive text data that should not pose any
      risks.  However, it is possible in theory that malicious binary
      data may be included in order to exploit potential buffer overruns
      in the program processing CSV data.  Additionally, private data
      may be shared via this format (which of course applies to any text
      data).

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


   Interoperability considerations:

      Due to lack of a single specification, there are considerable
      differences among implementations.  Implementors should "be
      conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from
      others" (RFC 793 [8]) when processing CSV files.  An attempt at a
      common definition can be found in Section 2.

      Implementations deciding not to use the optional "header"
      parameter must make their own decision as to whether the header is
      absent or present.

   Published specification:

      While numerous private specifications exist for various programs
      and systems, there is no single "master" specification for this
      format.  An attempt at a common definition can be found in Section
      2.

   Applications that use this media type:

      Spreadsheet programs and various data conversion utilities

   Additional information:

      Magic number(s): none

      File extension(s): CSV

      Macintosh File Type Code(s): TEXT

1.   INTRODUCTION

   Internet technical specifications often need to define a format
   syntax and are free to employ whatever notation their authors deem
   useful.  Over the years, a modified version of Backus-Naur Form
   (BNF), called Augmented BNF (ABNF), has been popular among many
   Internet specifications.  It balances compactness and simplicity,
   with reasonable representational power.  In the early days of the
   Arpanet, each specification contained its own definition of ABNF.
   This included the email specifications, RFC733 and then RFC822 which
   have come to be the common citations for defining ABNF.  The current
   document separates out that definition, to permit selective
   reference.  Predictably, it also provides some modifications and
   enhancements.

   The differences between standard BNF and ABNF involve naming rules,
   repetition, alternatives, order-independence, and value ranges.
   Appendix A (Core) supplies rule definitions and encoding for a core
   lexical analyzer of the type common to several Internet
   specifications.  It is provided as a convenience and is otherwise
   separate from the meta language defined in the body of this document,
   and separate from its formal status.

2.   RULE DEFINITION

2.1  Rule Naming

   The name of a rule is simply the name itself; that is, a sequence of
   characters, beginning with  an alphabetic character, and followed by
   a combination of alphabetics, digits and hyphens (dashes).

        NOTE:     Rule names are case-insensitive

   The names <rulename>, <Rulename>, <RULENAME> and <rUlENamE> all refer
   to the same rule.




Crocker & Overell           Standards Track                     [Page 2]

RFC 2234             ABNF for Syntax Specifications        November 1997


   Unlike original BNF, angle brackets ("<", ">") are not  required.
   However, angle brackets may be used around a rule name whenever their
   presence will facilitate discerning the use of  a rule name.  This is
   typically restricted to rule name references in free-form prose, or
   to distinguish partial rules that combine into a string not separated
   by white space, such as shown in the discussion about repetition,
   below.

2.2  Rule Form

   A rule is defined by the following sequence:

        name =  elements crlf

   where <name> is the name of the rule, <elements> is one or more rule
   names or terminal specifications and <crlf> is the end-of- line
   indicator, carriage return followed by line feed.  The equal sign
   separates the name from the definition of the rule.  The elements
   form a sequence of one or more rule names and/or value definitions,
   combined according to the various operators, defined in this
   document, such as alternative and repetition.

   For visual ease, rule definitions are left aligned.  When a rule
   requires multiple lines, the continuation lines are indented.  The
   left alignment and indentation are relative to the first lines of the
   ABNF rules and need not match the left margin of the document.

2.3  Terminal Values

   Rules resolve into a string of terminal values, sometimes called
   characters.  In ABNF a character is merely a non-negative integer.
   In certain contexts a specific mapping (encoding) of values into a
   character set (such as ASCII) will be specified.

   Terminals are specified by one or more numeric characters with the
   base interpretation of those characters indicated explicitly.  The
   following bases are currently defined:

        b           =  binary

        d           =  decimal

        x           =  hexadecimal

RFC 2234             ABNF for Syntax Specifications        November 1997


   Hence:

        CR          =  %d13

        CR          =  %x0D

   respectively specify the decimal and hexadecimal representation of
   [US-ASCII] for carriage return.

   A concatenated string of such values is specified compactly, using a
   period (".") to indicate separation of characters within that value.
   Hence:

        CRLF        =  %d13.10

   ABNF permits specifying literal text string directly, enclosed in
   quotation-marks.  Hence:

        command     =  "command string"

   Literal text strings are interpreted as a concatenated set of
   printable characters.

        NOTE:     ABNF strings are case-insensitive and
                  the character set for these strings is us-ascii.

   Hence:

        rulename = "abc"

   and:

        rulename = "aBc"

   will match "abc", "Abc", "aBc", "abC", "ABc", "aBC", "AbC" and "ABC".

                To specify a rule which IS case SENSITIVE,
                   specify the characters individually.

   For example:

        rulename    =  %d97 %d98 %d99

   or

        rulename    =  %d97.98.99

RFC 2234             ABNF for Syntax Specifications        November 1997


   will match only the string which comprises only lowercased
   characters, abc.

2.4  External Encodings

   External representations of terminal value characters will vary
   according to constraints in the storage or transmission environment.
   Hence, the same ABNF-based grammar may have multiple external
   encodings, such as one for a 7-bit US-ASCII environment, another for
   a binary octet environment and still a different one when 16-bit
   Unicode is used.  Encoding details are beyond the scope of ABNF,
   although Appendix A (Core) provides definitions for a 7-bit US-ASCII
   environment as has been common to much of the Internet.

   By separating external encoding from the syntax, it is intended that
   alternate encoding environments can be used for the same syntax.

3.   OPERATORS

3.1  Concatenation                                  Rule1 Rule2

   A rule can define a simple, ordered string of values -- i.e., a
   concatenation of contiguous characters -- by listing a sequence of
   rule names.  For example:

        foo         =  %x61           ; a

        bar         =  %x62           ; b

        mumble      =  foo bar foo

        So that the rule <mumble> matches the lowercase string "aba".

        LINEAR WHITE SPACE:  Concatenation is at the core of the ABNF
        parsing model.  A string of contiguous characters (values) is
        parsed according to the rules defined in ABNF.  For Internet
        specifications, there is some history of permitting linear white
        space (space and horizontal tab) to be freelyPand
        implicitlyPinterspersed around major constructs, such as
        delimiting special characters or atomic strings.

        NOTE:     This specification for ABNF does not
                  provide for implicit specification of linear white
                  space.

   Any grammar which wishes to permit linear white space around
   delimiters or string segments must specify it explicitly.  It is
   often useful to provide for such white space in "core" rules that are



Crocker & Overell           Standards Track                     [Page 5]

RFC 2234             ABNF for Syntax Specifications        November 1997


   then used variously among higher-level rules.  The "core" rules might
   be formed into a lexical analyzer or simply be part of the main
   ruleset.

3.2  Alternatives                               Rule1 / Rule2

   Elements separated by forward slash ("/") are alternatives.
   Therefore,

        foo / bar

   will accept <foo> or <bar>.

        NOTE:     A quoted string containing alphabetic
                  characters is special form for specifying alternative
                  characters and is interpreted as a non-terminal
                  representing the set of combinatorial strings with the
                  contained characters, in the specified order but with
                  any mixture of upper and lower case..

3.3  Incremental Alternatives                    Rule1 =/ Rule2

   It is sometimes convenient to specify a list of alternatives in
   fragments.  That is, an initial rule may match one or more
   alternatives, with later rule definitions adding to the set of
   alternatives.  This is particularly useful for otherwise- independent
   specifications which derive from the same parent rule set, such as
   often occurs with parameter lists.  ABNF permits this incremental
   definition through the construct:

        oldrule     =/ additional-alternatives

   So that the rule set

        ruleset     =  alt1 / alt2

        ruleset     =/ alt3

        ruleset     =/ alt4 / alt5

   is the same as specifying

        ruleset     =  alt1 / alt2 / alt3 / alt4 / alt5








Crocker & Overell           Standards Track                     [Page 6]

RFC 2234             ABNF for Syntax Specifications        November 1997


3.4  Value Range Alternatives                           %c##-##

   A range of alternative numeric values can be specified compactly,
   using dash ("-") to indicate the range of alternative values.  Hence:

        DIGIT       =  %x30-39

   is equivalent to:

        DIGIT       =  "0" / "1" / "2" / "3" / "4" / "5" / "6" /

                           "7" / "8" / "9"

   Concatenated numeric values and numeric value ranges can not be
   specified in the same string.  A numeric value may use the dotted
   notation for concatenation or it may use the dash notation to specify
   one value range.  Hence, to specify one printable character, between
   end of line sequences, the specification could be:

        char-line = %x0D.0A %x20-7E %x0D.0A

3.5  Sequence Group                             (Rule1 Rule2)

   Elements enclosed in parentheses are treated as a single element,
   whose contents are STRICTLY ORDERED.   Thus,

        elem (foo / bar) blat

   which matches (elem foo blat) or (elem bar blat).

        elem foo / bar blat

   matches (elem foo) or (bar blat).

        NOTE:     It is strongly advised to use grouping
                  notation, rather than to rely on proper reading of
                  "bare" alternations, when alternatives consist of
                  multiple rule names or literals.

   Hence it is recommended that instead of the above form, the form:

        (elem foo) / (bar blat)

   be used.  It will avoid misinterpretation by casual readers.

   The sequence group notation is also used within free text to set off
   an element sequence from the prose.

RFC 2234             ABNF for Syntax Specifications        November 1997


3.6  Variable Repetition                                *Rule

   The operator "*" preceding an element indicates repetition. The full
   form is:

        <a>*<b>element

   where <a> and <b> are optional decimal values, indicating at least
   <a> and at most <b> occurrences of element.

   Default values are 0 and infinity so that *<element> allows any
   number, including zero; 1*<element> requires at  least  one;
   3*3<element> allows exactly 3 and 1*2<element> allows one or two.

3.7  Specific Repetition                                  nRule

   A rule of the form:

        <n>element

   is equivalent to

        <n>*<n>element

   That is, exactly  <N>  occurrences  of <element>. Thus 2DIGIT is a
   2-digit number, and 3ALPHA is a string of three alphabetic
   characters.

3.8  Optional Sequence                                   [RULE]

   Square brackets enclose an optional element sequence:

        [foo bar]

   is equivalent to

        *1(foo bar).

3.9  ; Comment

   A semi-colon starts a comment that continues to the end of line.
   This is a simple way of including useful notes in parallel with the
   specifications.

RFC 2234             ABNF for Syntax Specifications        November 1997


3.10 Operator Precedence

   The various mechanisms described above have the following precedence,
   from highest (binding tightest) at the top, to lowest and loosest at
   the bottom:

        Strings, Names formation
        Comment
        Value range
        Repetition
        Grouping, Optional
        Concatenation
        Alternative

   Use of the alternative operator, freely mixed with concatenations can
   be confusing.

        Again, it is recommended that the grouping operator be used to
        make explicit concatenation groups.

   This syntax uses the rules provided in Appendix A (Core).

        rulename       =  ALPHA *(ALPHA / DIGIT / "-")

        defined-as     =  *c-wsp ("=" / "=/") *c-wsp

                               ;  incremental alternatives

        elements       =  alternation *c-wsp

        c-nl           =  comment / CRLF
                               ; comment or newline

        comment        =  ";" *(WSP / VCHAR) CRLF

        alternation    =  concatenation

5.   SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

   Security is truly believed to be irrelevant to this document.

6.   APPENDIX A - CORE

   This Appendix is provided as a convenient core for specific grammars.
   The definitions may be used as a core set of rules.

6.1  Core Rules

   Certain  basic  rules  are  in uppercase, such as SP, HTAB, CRLF,
   DIGIT, ALPHA, etc.

        ALPHA          =  %x41-5A / %x61-7A   ; A-Z / a-z

        BIT            =  "0" / "1"

        CHAR           =  %x01-7F
                               ; any 7-bit US-ASCII character,
                                  excluding NUL

        CR             =  %x0D
                               ; carriage return

        CRLF           =  CR LF
                               ; Internet standard newline

        CTL            =  %x00-1F / %x7F
                               ; controls

        DIGIT          =  %x30-39
                               ; 0-9

        DQUOTE         =  %x22
                               ; " (Double Quote)

        HEXDIG         =  DIGIT / "A" / "B" / "C" / "D" / "E" / "F"

        HTAB           =  %x09
                               ; horizontal tab

        LF             =  %x0A
                               ; linefeed

        LWSP           =  *(WSP / CRLF WSP)
                               ; linear white space (past newline)

        OCTET          =  %x00-FF
                               ; 8 bits of data

        SP             =  %x20

                               ; space

        VCHAR          =  %x21-7E
                               ; visible (printing) characters

        WSP            =  SP / HTAB
                               ; white space

6.2  Common Encoding

   Externally, data are represented as "network virtual ASCII", namely
   7-bit US-ASCII in an 8-bit field, with the high (8th) bit set to
   zero.  A string of values is in "network byte order" with the
   higher-valued bytes represented on the left-hand side and being sent
   over the network first.

7.   ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

   The syntax for ABNF was originally specified in RFC 733.  Ken L.
   Harrenstien, of SRI International, was responsible for re-coding the
   BNF into an augmented BNF that makes the representation smaller and
   easier to understand.

   This recent project began as a simple effort to cull out the portion
   of RFC 822 which has been repeatedly cited by non-email specification
   writers, namely the description of augmented BNF.  Rather than simply
   and blindly converting the existing text into a separate document,
   the working group chose to give careful consideration to the
   deficiencies, as well as benefits, of the existing specification and
   related specifications available over the last 15 years and therefore
   to pursue enhancement.  This turned the project into something rather
   more ambitious than first intended.  Interestingly the result is not
   massively different from that original, although decisions such as
   removing the list notation came as a surprise.

   The current round of specification was part of the DRUMS working
   group, with significant contributions from Jerome Abela , Harald
   Alvestrand, Robert Elz, Roger Fajman, Aviva Garrett, Tom Harsch, Dan
   Kohn, Bill McQuillan, Keith Moore, Chris Newman , Pete Resnick and
   Henning Schulzrinne.

Status of this Memo

   This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the

Abstract

   STD 11, RFC 822 defines a message representation protocol specifying
   considerable detail about US-ASCII message headers, but which leaves
   the message content, or message body, as flat US-ASCII text.  This
   set of documents, collectively called the Multipurpose Internet Mail
   Extensions, or MIME, redefines the format of messages to allow for

    (1)   textual message bodies in character sets other than
          US-ASCII,

    (2)   an extensible set of different formats for non-textual
          message bodies,

    (3)   multi-part message bodies, and

   orthogonal to (rather than a revision of) RFC 822.

1.  Introduction

   The first document in this set, RFC 2045, defines a number of header
   fields, including Content-Type. The Content-Type field is used to
   specify the nature of the data in the body of a MIME entity, by
   giving media type and subtype identifiers, and by providing auxiliary
   information that may be required for certain media types.  After the
   type and subtype names, the remainder of the header field is simply a
   set of parameters, specified in an attribute/value notation.  The
   ordering of parameters is not significant.

   In general, the top-level media type is used to declare the general
   type of data, while the subtype specifies a specific format for that
   type of data.  Thus, a media type of "image/xyz" is enough to tell a
   user agent that the data is an image, even if the user agent has no
   knowledge of the specific image format "xyz".  Such information can
   be used, for example, to decide whether or not to show a user the raw
   data from an unrecognized subtype -- such an action might be
   reasonable for unrecognized subtypes of "text", but not for
   unrecognized subtypes of "image" or "audio".  For this reason,
   registered subtypes of "text", "image", "audio", and "video" should
   not contain embedded information that is really of a different type.
   Such compound formats should be represented using the "multipart" or
   "application" types.

   Parameters are modifiers of the media subtype, and as such do not
   fundamentally affect the nature of the content.  The set of
   meaningful parameters depends on the media type and subtype.  Most
   parameters are associated with a single specific subtype.  However, a
   given top-level media type may define parameters which are applicable
   to any subtype of that type.  Parameters may be required by their
   defining media type or subtype or they may be optional.  MIME
   implementations must also ignore any parameters whose names they do
   not recognize.

   MIME's Content-Type header field and media type mechanism has been
   carefully designed to be extensible, and it is expected that the set
   of media type/subtype pairs and their associated parameters will grow
   significantly over time.  Several other MIME facilities, such as
   transfer encodings and "message/external-body" access types, are
   likely to have new values defined over time.  In order to ensure that
   the set of such values is developed in an orderly, well-specified,
   and public manner, MIME sets up a registration process which uses the
   Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) as a central registry for
   MIME's various areas of extensibility.  The registration process for
   these areas is described in a companion document, RFC 2048.

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


   The initial seven standard top-level media type are defined and
   described in the remainder of this document.

2.  Definition of a Top-Level Media Type

   The definition of a top-level media type consists of:

    (1)   a name and a description of the type, including
          criteria for whether a particular type would qualify
          under that type,

    (2)   the names and definitions of parameters, if any, which
          are defined for all subtypes of that type (including
          whether such parameters are required or optional),

    (3)   how a user agent and/or gateway should handle unknown
          subtypes of this type,

    (4)   general considerations on gatewaying entities of this
          top-level type, if any, and

    (5)   any restrictions on content-transfer-encodings for
          entities of this top-level type.

3.  Overview Of The Initial Top-Level Media Types

   The five discrete top-level media types are:

    (1)   text -- textual information.  The subtype "plain" in
          particular indicates plain text containing no
          formatting commands or directives of any sort. Plain
          text is intended to be displayed "as-is". No special
          software is required to get the full meaning of the
          text, aside from support for the indicated character
          set. Other subtypes are to be used for enriched text in
          forms where application software may enhance the
          appearance of the text, but such software must not be
          required in order to get the general idea of the
          content.  Possible subtypes of "text" thus include any
          word processor format that can be read without
          resorting to software that understands the format.  In
          particular, formats that employ embeddded binary
          formatting information are not considered directly
          readable. A very simple and portable subtype,
          "richtext", was defined in RFC 1341, with a further
          revision in RFC 1896 under the name "enriched".





Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                     [Page 4]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


    (2)   image -- image data.  "Image" requires a display device
          (such as a graphical display, a graphics printer, or a
          FAX machine) to view the information. An initial
          subtype is defined for the widely-used image format
          JPEG. .  subtypes are defined for two widely-used image
          formats, jpeg and gif.

    (3)   audio -- audio data.  "Audio" requires an audio output
          device (such as a speaker or a telephone) to "display"
          the contents.  An initial subtype "basic" is defined in
          this document.

    (4)   video -- video data.  "Video" requires the capability
          to display moving images, typically including
          specialized hardware and software.  An initial subtype
          "mpeg" is defined in this document.

    (5)   application -- some other kind of data, typically
          either uninterpreted binary data or information to be
          processed by an application.  The subtype "octet-
          stream" is to be used in the case of uninterpreted
          binary data, in which case the simplest recommended
          action is to offer to write the information into a file
          for the user.  The "PostScript" subtype is also defined
          for the transport of PostScript material.  Other
          expected uses for "application" include spreadsheets,
          data for mail-based scheduling systems, and languages
          for "active" (computational) messaging, and word
          processing formats that are not directly readable.
          Note that security considerations may exist for some
          types of application data, most notably
          "application/PostScript" and any form of active
          messaging.  These issues are discussed later in this
          document.

   The two composite top-level media types are:

    (1)   multipart -- data consisting of multiple entities of
          independent data types.  Four subtypes are initially
          defined, including the basic "mixed" subtype specifying
          a generic mixed set of parts, "alternative" for
          representing the same data in multiple formats,
          "parallel" for parts intended to be viewed
          simultaneously, and "digest" for multipart entities in
          which each part has a default type of "message/rfc822".






Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                     [Page 5]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


    (2)   message -- an encapsulated message.  A body of media
          type "message" is itself all or a portion of some kind
          of message object.  Such objects may or may not in turn
          contain other entities.  The "rfc822" subtype is used
          when the encapsulated content is itself an RFC 822
          message.  The "partial" subtype is defined for partial
          RFC 822 messages, to permit the fragmented transmission
          of bodies that are thought to be too large to be passed
          through transport facilities in one piece.  Another
          subtype, "external-body", is defined for specifying
          large bodies by reference to an external data source.

   It should be noted that the list of media type values given here may
   be augmented in time, via the mechanisms described above, and that
   the set of subtypes is expected to grow substantially.

4.  Discrete Media Type Values

   Five of the seven initial media type values refer to discrete bodies.
   The content of these types must be handled by non-MIME mechanisms;
   they are opaque to MIME processors.

4.1.  Text Media Type

   The "text" media type is intended for sending material which is
   principally textual in form.  A "charset" parameter may be used to
   indicate the character set of the body text for "text" subtypes,
   notably including the subtype "text/plain", which is a generic
   subtype for plain text.  Plain text does not provide for or allow
   formatting commands, font attribute specifications, processing
   instructions, interpretation directives, or content markup.  Plain
   text is seen simply as a linear sequence of characters, possibly
   interrupted by line breaks or page breaks.  Plain text may allow the
   stacking of several characters in the same position in the text.
   Plain text in scripts like Arabic and Hebrew may also include
   facilitites that allow the arbitrary mixing of text segments with
   opposite writing directions.

   Beyond plain text, there are many formats for representing what might
   be known as "rich text".  An interesting characteristic of many such
   representations is that they are to some extent readable even without
   the software that interprets them.  It is useful, then, to
   distinguish them, at the highest level, from such unreadable data as
   images, audio, or text represented in an unreadable form. In the
   absence of appropriate interpretation software, it is reasonable to
   show subtypes of "text" to the user, while it is not reasonable to do
   so with most nontextual data. Such formatted textual data should be
   represented using subtypes of "text".



Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                     [Page 6]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


4.1.1.  Representation of Line Breaks

   The canonical form of any MIME "text" subtype MUST always represent a
   line break as a CRLF sequence.  Similarly, any occurrence of CRLF in
   MIME "text" MUST represent a line break.  Use of CR and LF outside of
   line break sequences is also forbidden.

   This rule applies regardless of format or character set or sets
   involved.

   NOTE: The proper interpretation of line breaks when a body is
   displayed depends on the media type. In particular, while it is
   appropriate to treat a line break as a transition to a new line when
   displaying a "text/plain" body, this treatment is actually incorrect
   for other subtypes of "text" like "text/enriched" [RFC-1896].
   Similarly, whether or not line breaks should be added during display
   operations is also a function of the media type. It should not be
   necessary to add any line breaks to display "text/plain" correctly,
   whereas proper display of "text/enriched" requires the appropriate
   addition of line breaks.

   NOTE: Some protocols defines a maximum line length.  E.g. SMTP [RFC-
   821] allows a maximum of 998 octets before the next CRLF sequence.
   To be transported by such protocols, data which includes too long
   segments without CRLF sequences must be encoded with a suitable
   content-transfer-encoding.

4.1.2.  Charset Parameter

   A critical parameter that may be specified in the Content-Type field
   for "text/plain" data is the character set.  This is specified with a
   "charset" parameter, as in:

     Content-type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1

   Unlike some other parameter values, the values of the charset
   parameter are NOT case sensitive.  The default character set, which
   must be assumed in the absence of a charset parameter, is US-ASCII.

   The specification for any future subtypes of "text" must specify
   whether or not they will also utilize a "charset" parameter, and may
   possibly restrict its values as well.  For other subtypes of "text"
   than "text/plain", the semantics of the "charset" parameter should be
   defined to be identical to those specified here for "text/plain",
   i.e., the body consists entirely of characters in the given charset.
   In particular, definers of future "text" subtypes should pay close
   attention to the implications of multioctet character sets for their
   subtype definitions.



Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                     [Page 7]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


   The charset parameter for subtypes of "text" gives a name of a
   character set, as "character set" is defined in RFC 2045.  The rules
   regarding line breaks detailed in the previous section must also be
   observed -- a character set whose definition does not conform to
   these rules cannot be used in a MIME "text" subtype.

   An initial list of predefined character set names can be found at the
   end of this section.  Additional character sets may be registered
   with IANA.

   Other media types than subtypes of "text" might choose to employ the
   charset parameter as defined here, but with the CRLF/line break
   restriction removed.  Therefore, all character sets that conform to
   the general definition of "character set" in RFC 2045 can be
   registered for MIME use.

   Note that if the specified character set includes 8-bit characters
   and such characters are used in the body, a Content-Transfer-Encoding
   header field and a corresponding encoding on the data are required in
   order to transmit the body via some mail transfer protocols, such as
   SMTP [RFC-821].

   The default character set, US-ASCII, has been the subject of some
   confusion and ambiguity in the past.  Not only were there some
   ambiguities in the definition, there have been wide variations in
   practice.  In order to eliminate such ambiguity and variations in the
   future, it is strongly recommended that new user agents explicitly
   specify a character set as a media type parameter in the Content-Type
   header field. "US-ASCII" does not indicate an arbitrary 7-bit
   character set, but specifies that all octets in the body must be
   interpreted as characters according to the US-ASCII character set.
   National and application-oriented versions of ISO 646 [ISO-646] are
   usually NOT identical to US-ASCII, and in that case their use in
   Internet mail is explicitly discouraged.  The omission of the ISO 646
   character set from this document is deliberate in this regard.  The
   character set name of "US-ASCII" explicitly refers to the character
   set defined in ANSI X3.4-1986 [US- ASCII].  The new international
   reference version (IRV) of the 1991 edition of ISO 646 is identical
   to US-ASCII.  The character set name "ASCII" is reserved and must not
   be used for any purpose.

   NOTE: RFC 821 explicitly specifies "ASCII", and references an earlier
   version of the American Standard.  Insofar as one of the purposes of
   specifying a media type and character set is to permit the receiver
   to unambiguously determine how the sender intended the coded message
   to be interpreted, assuming anything other than "strict ASCII" as the
   default would risk unintentional and incompatible changes to the
   semantics of messages now being transmitted.  This also implies that



Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                     [Page 8]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


   messages containing characters coded according to other versions of
   ISO 646 than US-ASCII and the 1991 IRV, or using code-switching
   procedures (e.g., those of ISO 2022), as well as 8bit or multiple
   octet character encodings MUST use an appropriate character set
   specification to be consistent with MIME.

   The complete US-ASCII character set is listed in ANSI X3.4- 1986.
   Note that the control characters including DEL (0-31, 127) have no
   defined meaning in apart from the combination CRLF (US-ASCII values
   13 and 10) indicating a new line.  Two of the characters have de
   facto meanings in wide use: FF (12) often means "start subsequent
   text on the beginning of a new page"; and TAB or HT (9) often (though
   not always) means "move the cursor to the next available column after
   the current position where the column number is a multiple of 8
   (counting the first column as column 0)."  Aside from these
   conventions, any use of the control characters or DEL in a body must
   either occur

    (1)   because a subtype of text other than "plain"
          specifically assigns some additional meaning, or

    (2)   within the context of a private agreement between the
          sender and recipient. Such private agreements are
          discouraged and should be replaced by the other
          capabilities of this document.

   NOTE: An enormous proliferation of character sets exist beyond US-
   ASCII.  A large number of partially or totally overlapping character
   sets is NOT a good thing.  A SINGLE character set that can be used
   universally for representing all of the world's languages in Internet
   mail would be preferrable.  Unfortunately, existing practice in
   several communities seems to point to the continued use of multiple
   character sets in the near future.  A small number of standard
   character sets are, therefore, defined for Internet use in this
   document.

   The defined charset values are:

    (1)   US-ASCII -- as defined in ANSI X3.4-1986 [US-ASCII].

    (2)   ISO-8859-X -- where "X" is to be replaced, as
          necessary, for the parts of ISO-8859 [ISO-8859].  Note
          that the ISO 646 character sets have deliberately been
          omitted in favor of their 8859 replacements, which are
          the designated character sets for Internet mail.  As of
          the publication of this document, the legitimate values
          for "X" are the digits 1 through 10.




Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                     [Page 9]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


   Characters in the range 128-159 has no assigned meaning in ISO-8859-
   X.  Characters with values below 128 in ISO-8859-X have the same
   assigned meaning as they do in US-ASCII.

   Part 6 of ISO 8859 (Latin/Arabic alphabet) and part 8 (Latin/Hebrew
   alphabet) includes both characters for which the normal writing
   direction is right to left and characters for which it is left to
   right, but do not define a canonical ordering method for representing
   bi-directional text.  The charset values "ISO-8859-6" and "ISO-8859-
   8", however, specify that the visual method is used [RFC-1556].

   All of these character sets are used as pure 7bit or 8bit sets
   without any shift or escape functions.  The meaning of shift and
   escape sequences in these character sets is not defined.

   The character sets specified above are the ones that were relatively
   uncontroversial during the drafting of MIME.  This document does not
   endorse the use of any particular character set other than US-ASCII,
   and recognizes that the future evolution of world character sets
   remains unclear.

   Note that the character set used, if anything other than US- ASCII,
   must always be explicitly specified in the Content-Type field.

   No character set name other than those defined above may be used in
   Internet mail without the publication of a formal specification and
   its registration with IANA, or by private agreement, in which case
   the character set name must begin with "X-".

   Implementors are discouraged from defining new character sets unless
   absolutely necessary.

   The "charset" parameter has been defined primarily for the purpose of
   textual data, and is described in this section for that reason.
   However, it is conceivable that non-textual data might also wish to
   specify a charset value for some purpose, in which case the same
   syntax and values should be used.

   In general, composition software should always use the "lowest common
   denominator" character set possible.  For example, if a body contains
   only US-ASCII characters, it SHOULD be marked as being in the US-
   ASCII character set, not ISO-8859-1, which, like all the ISO-8859
   family of character sets, is a superset of US-ASCII.  More generally,
   if a widely-used character set is a subset of another character set,
   and a body contains only characters in the widely-used subset, it
   should be labelled as being in that subset.  This will increase the
   chances that the recipient will be able to view the resulting entity
   correctly.

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


4.1.3.  Plain Subtype

   The simplest and most important subtype of "text" is "plain".  This
   indicates plain text that does not contain any formatting commands or
   directives. Plain text is intended to be displayed "as-is", that is,
   no interpretation of embedded formatting commands, font attribute
   specifications, processing instructions, interpretation directives,
   or content markup should be necessary for proper display.  The
   default media type of "text/plain; charset=us-ascii" for Internet
   mail describes existing Internet practice.  That is, it is the type
   of body defined by RFC 822.

   No other "text" subtype is defined by this document.

4.1.4.  Unrecognized Subtypes

   Unrecognized subtypes of "text" should be treated as subtype "plain"
   as long as the MIME implementation knows how to handle the charset.
   Unrecognized subtypes which also specify an unrecognized charset
   should be treated as "application/octet- stream".

4.2.  Image Media Type

   A media type of "image" indicates that the body contains an image.
   The subtype names the specific image format.  These names are not
   case sensitive. An initial subtype is "jpeg" for the JPEG format
   using JFIF encoding [JPEG].

   The list of "image" subtypes given here is neither exclusive nor
   exhaustive, and is expected to grow as more types are registered with
   IANA, as described in RFC 2048.

   Unrecognized subtypes of "image" should at a miniumum be treated as
   "application/octet-stream".  Implementations may optionally elect to
   pass subtypes of "image" that they do not specifically recognize to a
   secure and robust general-purpose image viewing application, if such
   an application is available.

   NOTE: Using of a generic-purpose image viewing application this way
   inherits the security problems of the most dangerous type supported
   by the application.

4.3.  Audio Media Type

   A media type of "audio" indicates that the body contains audio data.
   Although there is not yet a consensus on an "ideal" audio format for
   use with computers, there is a pressing need for a format capable of
   providing interoperable behavior.



Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                    [Page 11]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


   The initial subtype of "basic" is specified to meet this requirement
   by providing an absolutely minimal lowest common denominator audio
   format.  It is expected that richer formats for higher quality and/or
   lower bandwidth audio will be defined by a later document.

   The content of the "audio/basic" subtype is single channel audio
   encoded using 8bit ISDN mu-law [PCM] at a sample rate of 8000 Hz.

   Unrecognized subtypes of "audio" should at a miniumum be treated as
   "application/octet-stream".  Implementations may optionally elect to
   pass subtypes of "audio" that they do not specifically recognize to a
   robust general-purpose audio playing application, if such an
   application is available.

4.4.  Video Media Type

   A media type of "video" indicates that the body contains a time-
   varying-picture image, possibly with color and coordinated sound.
   The term 'video' is used in its most generic sense, rather than with
   reference to any particular technology or format, and is not meant to
   preclude subtypes such as animated drawings encoded compactly.  The
   subtype "mpeg" refers to video coded according to the MPEG standard
   [MPEG].

   Note that although in general this document strongly discourages the
   mixing of multiple media in a single body, it is recognized that many
   so-called video formats include a representation for synchronized
   audio, and this is explicitly permitted for subtypes of "video".

   Unrecognized subtypes of "video" should at a minumum be treated as
   "application/octet-stream".  Implementations may optionally elect to
   pass subtypes of "video" that they do not specifically recognize to a
   robust general-purpose video display application, if such an
   application is available.

4.5.  Application Media Type

   The "application" media type is to be used for discrete data which do
   not fit in any of the other categories, and particularly for data to
   be processed by some type of application program.  This is
   information which must be processed by an application before it is
   viewable or usable by a user.  Expected uses for the "application"
   media type include file transfer, spreadsheets, data for mail-based
   scheduling systems, and languages for "active" (computational)
   material.  (The latter, in particular, can pose security problems
   which must be understood by implementors, and are considered in
   detail in the discussion of the "application/PostScript" media type.)




Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                    [Page 12]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


   For example, a meeting scheduler might define a standard
   representation for information about proposed meeting dates.  An
   intelligent user agent would use this information to conduct a dialog
   with the user, and might then send additional material based on that
   dialog.  More generally, there have been several "active" messaging
   languages developed in which programs in a suitably specialized
   language are transported to a remote location and automatically run
   in the recipient's environment.

   Such applications may be defined as subtypes of the "application"
   media type. This document defines two subtypes:

   octet-stream, and PostScript.

   The subtype of "application" will often be either the name or include
   part of the name of the application for which the data are intended.
   This does not mean, however, that any application program name may be
   used freely as a subtype of "application".

4.5.1.  Octet-Stream Subtype

   The "octet-stream" subtype is used to indicate that a body contains
   arbitrary binary data.  The set of currently defined parameters is:

    (1)   TYPE -- the general type or category of binary data.
          This is intended as information for the human recipient
          rather than for any automatic processing.

    (2)   PADDING -- the number of bits of padding that were
          appended to the bit-stream comprising the actual
          contents to produce the enclosed 8bit byte-oriented
          data.  This is useful for enclosing a bit-stream in a
          body when the total number of bits is not a multiple of
          8.

   Both of these parameters are optional.

   An additional parameter, "CONVERSIONS", was defined in RFC 1341 but
   has since been removed.  RFC 1341 also defined the use of a "NAME"
   parameter which gave a suggested file name to be used if the data
   were to be written to a file.  This has been deprecated in
   anticipation of a separate Content-Disposition header field, to be
   defined in a subsequent RFC.

   The recommended action for an implementation that receives an
   "application/octet-stream" entity is to simply offer to put the data
   in a file, with any Content-Transfer-Encoding undone, or perhaps to
   use it as input to a user-specified process.



Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                    [Page 13]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


   To reduce the danger of transmitting rogue programs, it is strongly
   recommended that implementations NOT implement a path-search
   mechanism whereby an arbitrary program named in the Content-Type
   parameter (e.g., an "interpreter=" parameter) is found and executed
   using the message body as input.

4.5.2.  PostScript Subtype

   A media type of "application/postscript" indicates a PostScript
   program.  Currently two variants of the PostScript language are
   allowed; the original level 1 variant is described in [POSTSCRIPT]
   and the more recent level 2 variant is described in [POSTSCRIPT2].

   PostScript is a registered trademark of Adobe Systems, Inc.  Use of
   the MIME media type "application/postscript" implies recognition of
   that trademark and all the rights it entails.

   The PostScript language definition provides facilities for internal
   labelling of the specific language features a given program uses.
   This labelling, called the PostScript document structuring
   conventions, or DSC, is very general and provides substantially more
   information than just the language level.  The use of document
   structuring conventions, while not required, is strongly recommended
   as an aid to interoperability.  Documents which lack proper
   structuring conventions cannot be tested to see whether or not they
   will work in a given environment.  As such, some systems may assume
   the worst and refuse to process unstructured documents.

   The execution of general-purpose PostScript interpreters entails
   serious security risks, and implementors are discouraged from simply
   sending PostScript bodies to "off- the-shelf" interpreters.  While it
   is usually safe to send PostScript to a printer, where the potential
   for harm is greatly constrained by typical printer environments,
   implementors should consider all of the following before they add
   interactive display of PostScript bodies to their MIME readers.

   The remainder of this section outlines some, though probably not all,
   of the possible problems with the transport of PostScript entities.

    (1)   Dangerous operations in the PostScript language
          include, but may not be limited to, the PostScript
          operators "deletefile", "renamefile", "filenameforall",
          and "file".  "File" is only dangerous when applied to
          something other than standard input or output.
          Implementations may also define additional nonstandard
          file operators; these may also pose a threat to
          security. "Filenameforall", the wildcard file search
          operator, may appear at first glance to be harmless.



Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                    [Page 14]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


          Note, however, that this operator has the potential to
          reveal information about what files the recipient has
          access to, and this information may itself be
          sensitive.  Message senders should avoid the use of
          potentially dangerous file operators, since these
          operators are quite likely to be unavailable in secure
          PostScript implementations.  Message receiving and
          displaying software should either completely disable
          all potentially dangerous file operators or take
          special care not to delegate any special authority to
          their operation.  These operators should be viewed as
          being done by an outside agency when interpreting
          PostScript documents.  Such disabling and/or checking
          should be done completely outside of the reach of the
          PostScript language itself; care should be taken to
          insure that no method exists for re-enabling full-
          function versions of these operators.

    (2)   The PostScript language provides facilities for exiting
          the normal interpreter, or server, loop.  Changes made
          in this "outer" environment are customarily retained
          across documents, and may in some cases be retained
          semipermanently in nonvolatile memory.  The operators
          associated with exiting the interpreter loop have the
          potential to interfere with subsequent document
          processing.  As such, their unrestrained use
          constitutes a threat of service denial.  PostScript
          operators that exit the interpreter loop include, but
          may not be limited to, the exitserver and startjob
          operators.  Message sending software should not
          generate PostScript that depends on exiting the
          interpreter loop to operate, since the ability to exit
          will probably be unavailable in secure PostScript
          implementations.  Message receiving and displaying
          software should completely disable the ability to make
          retained changes to the PostScript environment by
          eliminating or disabling the "startjob" and
          "exitserver" operations.  If these operations cannot be
          eliminated or completely disabled the password
          associated with them should at least be set to a hard-
          to-guess value.

    (3)   PostScript provides operators for setting system-wide
          and device-specific parameters.  These parameter
          settings may be retained across jobs and may
          potentially pose a threat to the correct operation of
          the interpreter.  The PostScript operators that set
          system and device parameters include, but may not be



Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                    [Page 15]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


          limited to, the "setsystemparams" and "setdevparams"
          operators.  Message sending software should not
          generate PostScript that depends on the setting of
          system or device parameters to operate correctly.  The
          ability to set these parameters will probably be
          unavailable in secure PostScript implementations.
          Message receiving and displaying software should
          disable the ability to change system and device
          parameters.  If these operators cannot be completely
          disabled the password associated with them should at
          least be set to a hard-to-guess value.

    (4)   Some PostScript implementations provide nonstandard
          facilities for the direct loading and execution of
          machine code.  Such facilities are quite obviously open
          to substantial abuse.  Message sending software should
          not make use of such features.  Besides being totally
          hardware-specific, they are also likely to be
          unavailable in secure implementations of PostScript.
          Message receiving and displaying software should not
          allow such operators to be used if they exist.

    (5)   PostScript is an extensible language, and many, if not
          most, implementations of it provide a number of their
          own extensions.  This document does not deal with such
          extensions explicitly since they constitute an unknown
          factor.  Message sending software should not make use
          of nonstandard extensions; they are likely to be
          missing from some implementations.  Message receiving
          and displaying software should make sure that any
          nonstandard PostScript operators are secure and don't
          present any kind of threat.

    (6)   It is possible to write PostScript that consumes huge
          amounts of various system resources.  It is also
          possible to write PostScript programs that loop
          indefinitely.  Both types of programs have the
          potential to cause damage if sent to unsuspecting
          recipients.  Message-sending software should avoid the
          construction and dissemination of such programs, which
          is antisocial.  Message receiving and displaying
          software should provide appropriate mechanisms to abort
          processing after a reasonable amount of time has
          elapsed. In addition, PostScript interpreters should be
          limited to the consumption of only a reasonable amount
          of any given system resource.





Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                    [Page 16]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


    (7)   It is possible to include raw binary information inside
          PostScript in various forms.  This is not recommended
          for use in Internet mail, both because it is not
          supported by all PostScript interpreters and because it
          significantly complicates the use of a MIME Content-
          Transfer-Encoding.  (Without such binary, PostScript
          may typically be viewed as line-oriented data.  The
          treatment of CRLF sequences becomes extremely
          problematic if binary and line-oriented data are mixed
          in a single Postscript data stream.)

    (8)   Finally, bugs may exist in some PostScript interpreters
          which could possibly be exploited to gain unauthorized
          access to a recipient's system.  Apart from noting this
          possibility, there is no specific action to take to
          prevent this, apart from the timely correction of such
          bugs if any are found.

4.5.3.  Other Application Subtypes

   It is expected that many other subtypes of "application" will be
   defined in the future.  MIME implementations must at a minimum treat
   any unrecognized subtypes as being equivalent to "application/octet-
   stream".

5.  Composite Media Type Values

   The remaining two of the seven initial Content-Type values refer to
   composite entities.  Composite entities are handled using MIME
   mechanisms -- a MIME processor typically handles the body directly.

5.1.  Multipart Media Type

   In the case of multipart entities, in which one or more different
   sets of data are combined in a single body, a "multipart" media type
   field must appear in the entity's header.  The body must then contain
   one or more body parts, each preceded by a boundary delimiter line,
   and the last one followed by a closing boundary delimiter line.
   After its boundary delimiter line, each body part then consists of a
   header area, a blank line, and a body area.  Thus a body part is
   similar to an RFC 822 message in syntax, but different in meaning.

   A body part is an entity and hence is NOT to be interpreted as
   actually being an RFC 822 message.  To begin with, NO header fields
   are actually required in body parts.  A body part that starts with a
   blank line, therefore, is allowed and is a body part for which all
   default values are to be assumed.  In such a case, the absence of a
   Content-Type header usually indicates that the corresponding body has



Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                    [Page 17]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


   a content-type of "text/plain; charset=US-ASCII".

   The only header fields that have defined meaning for body parts are
   those the names of which begin with "Content-".  All other header
   fields may be ignored in body parts.  Although they should generally
   be retained if at all possible, they may be discarded by gateways if
   necessary.  Such other fields are permitted to appear in body parts
   but must not be depended on.  "X-" fields may be created for
   experimental or private purposes, with the recognition that the
   information they contain may be lost at some gateways.

   NOTE:  The distinction between an RFC 822 message and a body part is
   subtle, but important.  A gateway between Internet and X.400 mail,
   for example, must be able to tell the difference between a body part
   that contains an image and a body part that contains an encapsulated
   message, the body of which is a JPEG image.  In order to represent
   the latter, the body part must have "Content-Type: message/rfc822",
   and its body (after the blank line) must be the encapsulated message,
   with its own "Content-Type: image/jpeg" header field.  The use of
   similar syntax facilitates the conversion of messages to body parts,
   and vice versa, but the distinction between the two must be
   understood by implementors.  (For the special case in which parts
   actually are messages, a "digest" subtype is also defined.)

   As stated previously, each body part is preceded by a boundary
   delimiter line that contains the boundary delimiter.  The boundary
   delimiter MUST NOT appear inside any of the encapsulated parts, on a
   line by itself or as the prefix of any line.  This implies that it is
   crucial that the composing agent be able to choose and specify a
   unique boundary parameter value that does not contain the boundary
   parameter value of an enclosing multipart as a prefix.

   All present and future subtypes of the "multipart" type must use an
   identical syntax.  Subtypes may differ in their semantics, and may
   impose additional restrictions on syntax, but must conform to the
   required syntax for the "multipart" type.  This requirement ensures
   that all conformant user agents will at least be able to recognize
   and separate the parts of any multipart entity, even those of an
   unrecognized subtype.

   As stated in the definition of the Content-Transfer-Encoding field
   [RFC 2045], no encoding other than "7bit", "8bit", or "binary" is
   permitted for entities of type "multipart".  The "multipart" boundary
   delimiters and header fields are always represented as 7bit US-ASCII
   in any case (though the header fields may encode non-US-ASCII header
   text as per RFC 2047) and data within the body parts can be encoded
   on a part-by-part basis, with Content-Transfer-Encoding fields for
   each appropriate body part.



Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                    [Page 18]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


5.1.1.  Common Syntax

   This section defines a common syntax for subtypes of "multipart".
   All subtypes of "multipart" must use this syntax.  A simple example
   of a multipart message also appears in this section.  An example of a
   more complex multipart message is given in RFC 2049.

   The Content-Type field for multipart entities requires one parameter,
   "boundary". The boundary delimiter line is then defined as a line
   consisting entirely of two hyphen characters ("-", decimal value 45)
   followed by the boundary parameter value from the Content-Type header
   field, optional linear whitespace, and a terminating CRLF.

   NOTE:  The hyphens are for rough compatibility with the earlier RFC
   934 method of message encapsulation, and for ease of searching for
   the boundaries in some implementations.  However, it should be noted
   that multipart messages are NOT completely compatible with RFC 934
   encapsulations; in particular, they do not obey RFC 934 quoting
   conventions for embedded lines that begin with hyphens.  This
   mechanism was chosen over the RFC 934 mechanism because the latter
   causes lines to grow with each level of quoting.  The combination of
   this growth with the fact that SMTP implementations sometimes wrap
   long lines made the RFC 934 mechanism unsuitable for use in the event
   that deeply-nested multipart structuring is ever desired.

   WARNING TO IMPLEMENTORS:  The grammar for parameters on the Content-
   type field is such that it is often necessary to enclose the boundary
   parameter values in quotes on the Content-type line.  This is not
   always necessary, but never hurts. Implementors should be sure to
   study the grammar carefully in order to avoid producing invalid
   Content-type fields.  Thus, a typical "multipart" Content-Type header
   field might look like this:

     Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=gc0p4Jq0M2Yt08j34c0p

   But the following is not valid:

     Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=gc0pJq0M:08jU534c0p

   (because of the colon) and must instead be represented as

     Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary="gc0pJq0M:08jU534c0p"

   This Content-Type value indicates that the content consists of one or
   more parts, each with a structure that is syntactically identical to
   an RFC 822 message, except that the header area is allowed to be
   completely empty, and that the parts are each preceded by the line




Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                    [Page 19]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


     --gc0pJq0M:08jU534c0p

   The boundary delimiter MUST occur at the beginning of a line, i.e.,
   following a CRLF, and the initial CRLF is considered to be attached
   to the boundary delimiter line rather than part of the preceding
   part.  The boundary may be followed by zero or more characters of
   linear whitespace. It is then terminated by either another CRLF and
   the header fields for the next part, or by two CRLFs, in which case
   there are no header fields for the next part.  If no Content-Type
   field is present it is assumed to be "message/rfc822" in a
   "multipart/digest" and "text/plain" otherwise.

   NOTE:  The CRLF preceding the boundary delimiter line is conceptually
   attached to the boundary so that it is possible to have a part that
   does not end with a CRLF (line  break).  Body parts that must be
   considered to end with line breaks, therefore, must have two CRLFs
   preceding the boundary delimiter line, the first of which is part of
   the preceding body part, and the second of which is part of the
   encapsulation boundary.

   Boundary delimiters must not appear within the encapsulated material,
   and must be no longer than 70 characters, not counting the two
   leading hyphens.

   The boundary delimiter line following the last body part is a
   distinguished delimiter that indicates that no further body parts
   will follow.  Such a delimiter line is identical to the previous
   delimiter lines, with the addition of two more hyphens after the
   boundary parameter value.

     --gc0pJq0M:08jU534c0p--

   NOTE TO IMPLEMENTORS:  Boundary string comparisons must compare the
   boundary value with the beginning of each candidate line.  An exact
   match of the entire candidate line is not required; it is sufficient
   that the boundary appear in its entirety following the CRLF.

   There appears to be room for additional information prior to the
   first boundary delimiter line and following the final boundary
   delimiter line.  These areas should generally be left blank, and
   implementations must ignore anything that appears before the first
   boundary delimiter line or after the last one.

   NOTE:  These "preamble" and "epilogue" areas are generally not used
   because of the lack of proper typing of these parts and the lack of
   clear semantics for handling these areas at gateways, particularly
   X.400 gateways.  However, rather than leaving the preamble area
   blank, many MIME implementations have found this to be a convenient



Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                    [Page 20]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


   place to insert an explanatory note for recipients who read the
   message with pre-MIME software, since such notes will be ignored by
   MIME-compliant software.

   NOTE:  Because boundary delimiters must not appear in the body parts
   being encapsulated, a user agent must exercise care to choose a
   unique boundary parameter value.  The boundary parameter value in the
   example above could have been the result of an algorithm designed to
   produce boundary delimiters with a very low probability of already
   existing in the data to be encapsulated without having to prescan the
   data.  Alternate algorithms might result in more "readable" boundary
   delimiters for a recipient with an old user agent, but would require
   more attention to the possibility that the boundary delimiter might
   appear at the beginning of some line in the encapsulated part.  The
   simplest boundary delimiter line possible is something like "---",
   with a closing boundary delimiter line of "-----".

   As a very simple example, the following multipart message has two
   parts, both of them plain text, one of them explicitly typed and one
   of them implicitly typed:

     From: Nathaniel Borenstein <nsb@bellcore.com>
     To: Ned Freed <ned@innosoft.com>
     Date: Sun, 21 Mar 1993 23:56:48 -0800 (PST)
     Subject: Sample message
     MIME-Version: 1.0
     Content-type: multipart/mixed; boundary="simple boundary"

     This is the preamble.  It is to be ignored, though it
     is a handy place for composition agents to include an
     explanatory note to non-MIME conformant readers.

     --simple boundary

     This is implicitly typed plain US-ASCII text.
     It does NOT end with a linebreak.
     --simple boundary
     Content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

     This is explicitly typed plain US-ASCII text.
     It DOES end with a linebreak.

     --simple boundary--

     This is the epilogue.  It is also to be ignored.






Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                    [Page 21]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


   The use of a media type of "multipart" in a body part within another
   "multipart" entity is explicitly allowed.  In such cases, for obvious
   reasons, care must be taken to ensure that each nested "multipart"
   entity uses a different boundary delimiter.  See RFC 2049 for an
   example of nested "multipart" entities.

   The use of the "multipart" media type with only a single body part
   may be useful in certain contexts, and is explicitly permitted.

   NOTE: Experience has shown that a "multipart" media type with a
   single body part is useful for sending non-text media types.  It has
   the advantage of providing the preamble as a place to include
   decoding instructions.  In addition, a number of SMTP gateways move
   or remove the MIME headers, and a clever MIME decoder can take a good
   guess at multipart boundaries even in the absence of the Content-Type
   header and thereby successfully decode the message.

   The only mandatory global parameter for the "multipart" media type is
   the boundary parameter, which consists of 1 to 70 characters from a
   set of characters known to be very robust through mail gateways, and
   NOT ending with white space. (If a boundary delimiter line appears to
   end with white space, the white space must be presumed to have been
   added by a gateway, and must be deleted.)  It is formally specified
   by the following BNF:

     boundary := 0*69<bchars> bcharsnospace

     bchars := bcharsnospace / " "

     bcharsnospace := DIGIT / ALPHA / "'" / "(" / ")" /
                      "+" / "_" / "," / "-" / "." /
                      "/" / ":" / "=" / "?"

   Overall, the body of a "multipart" entity may be specified as
   follows:

     dash-boundary := "--" boundary
                      ; boundary taken from the value of
                      ; boundary parameter of the
                      ; Content-Type field.

     multipart-body := [preamble CRLF]
                       dash-boundary transport-padding CRLF
                       body-part *encapsulation
                       close-delimiter transport-padding
                       [CRLF epilogue]

   IMPORTANT:  The free insertion of linear-white-space and RFC 822
   comments between the elements shown in this BNF is NOT allowed since
   this BNF does not specify a structured header field.

   NOTE:  In certain transport enclaves, RFC 822 restrictions such as
   the one that limits bodies to printable US-ASCII characters may not
   be in force. (That is, the transport domains may exist that resemble
   standard Internet mail transport as specified in RFC 821 and assumed
   by RFC 822, but without certain restrictions.) The relaxation of
   these restrictions should be construed as locally extending the
   definition of bodies, for example to include octets outside of the
   US-ASCII range, as long as these extensions are supported by the
   transport and adequately documented in the Content- Transfer-Encoding
   header field.  However, in no event are headers (either message
   headers or body part headers) allowed to contain anything other than
   US-ASCII characters.



Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                    [Page 23]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


   NOTE:  Conspicuously missing from the "multipart" type is a notion of
   structured, related body parts. It is recommended that those wishing
   to provide more structured or integrated multipart messaging
   facilities should define subtypes of multipart that are syntactically
   identical but define relationships between the various parts. For
   example, subtypes of multipart could be defined that include a
   distinguished part which in turn is used to specify the relationships
   between the other parts, probably referring to them by their
   Content-ID field.  Old implementations will not recognize the new
   subtype if this approach is used, but will treat it as
   multipart/mixed and will thus be able to show the user the parts that
   are recognized.

5.1.2.  Handling Nested Messages and Multiparts

   The "message/rfc822" subtype defined in a subsequent section of this
   document has no terminating condition other than running out of data.
   Similarly, an improperly truncated "multipart" entity may not have
   any terminating boundary marker, and can turn up operationally due to
   mail system malfunctions.

   It is essential that such entities be handled correctly when they are
   themselves imbedded inside of another "multipart" structure.  MIME
   implementations are therefore required to recognize outer level
   boundary markers at ANY level of inner nesting.  It is not sufficient
   to only check for the next expected marker or other terminating
   condition.

5.1.3.  Mixed Subtype

   The "mixed" subtype of "multipart" is intended for use when the body
   parts are independent and need to be bundled in a particular order.
   Any "multipart" subtypes that an implementation does not recognize
   must be treated as being of subtype "mixed".

5.1.4.  Alternative Subtype

   The "multipart/alternative" type is syntactically identical to
   "multipart/mixed", but the semantics are different.  In particular,
   each of the body parts is an "alternative" version of the same
   information.

   Systems should recognize that the content of the various parts are
   interchangeable.  Systems should choose the "best" type based on the
   local environment and references, in some cases even through user
   interaction.  As with "multipart/mixed", the order of body parts is
   significant.  In this case, the alternatives appear in an order of
   increasing faithfulness to the original content.  In general, the



Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                    [Page 24]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


   best choice is the LAST part of a type supported by the recipient
   system's local environment.

   "Multipart/alternative" may be used, for example, to send a message
   in a fancy text format in such a way that it can easily be displayed
   anywhere:

     From: Nathaniel Borenstein <nsb@bellcore.com>
     To: Ned Freed <ned@innosoft.com>
     Date: Mon, 22 Mar 1993 09:41:09 -0800 (PST)
     Subject: Formatted text mail
     MIME-Version: 1.0
     Content-Type: multipart/alternative; boundary=boundary42

     --boundary42
     Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

       ... plain text version of message goes here ...

     --boundary42
     Content-Type: text/enriched

       ... RFC 1896 text/enriched version of same message
           goes here ...

     --boundary42
     Content-Type: application/x-whatever

       ... fanciest version of same message goes here ...

     --boundary42--

   In this example, users whose mail systems understood the
   "application/x-whatever" format would see only the fancy version,
   while other users would see only the enriched or plain text version,
   depending on the capabilities of their system.

   In general, user agents that compose "multipart/alternative" entities
   must place the body parts in increasing order of preference, that is,
   with the preferred format last.  For fancy text, the sending user
   agent should put the plainest format first and the richest format
   last.  Receiving user agents should pick and display the last format
   they are capable of displaying.  In the case where one of the
   alternatives is itself of type "multipart" and contains unrecognized
   sub-parts, the user agent may choose either to show that alternative,
   an earlier alternative, or both.





Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                    [Page 25]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


   NOTE: From an implementor's perspective, it might seem more sensible
   to reverse this ordering, and have the plainest alternative last.
   However, placing the plainest alternative first is the friendliest
   possible option when "multipart/alternative" entities are viewed
   using a non-MIME-conformant viewer.  While this approach does impose
   some burden on conformant MIME viewers, interoperability with older
   mail readers was deemed to be more important in this case.

   It may be the case that some user agents, if they can recognize more
   than one of the formats, will prefer to offer the user the choice of
   which format to view.  This makes sense, for example, if a message
   includes both a nicely- formatted image version and an easily-edited
   text version.  What is most critical, however, is that the user not
   automatically be shown multiple versions of the same data.  Either
   the user should be shown the last recognized version or should be
   given the choice.

   THE SEMANTICS OF CONTENT-ID IN MULTIPART/ALTERNATIVE:  Each part of a
   "multipart/alternative" entity represents the same data, but the
   mappings between the two are not necessarily without information
   loss.  For example, information is lost when translating ODA to
   PostScript or plain text.  It is recommended that each part should
   have a different Content-ID value in the case where the information
   content of the two parts is not identical.  And when the information
   content is identical -- for example, where several parts of type
   "message/external-body" specify alternate ways to access the
   identical data -- the same Content-ID field value should be used, to
   optimize any caching mechanisms that might be present on the
   recipient's end.  However, the Content-ID values used by the parts
   should NOT be the same Content-ID value that describes the
   "multipart/alternative" as a whole, if there is any such Content-ID
   field.  That is, one Content-ID value will refer to the
   "multipart/alternative" entity, while one or more other Content-ID
   values will refer to the parts inside it.

5.1.5.  Digest Subtype

   This document defines a "digest" subtype of the "multipart" Content-
   Type.  This type is syntactically identical to "multipart/mixed", but
   the semantics are different.  In particular, in a digest, the default
   Content-Type value for a body part is changed from "text/plain" to
   "message/rfc822".  This is done to allow a more readable digest
   format that is largely compatible (except for the quoting convention)
   with RFC 934.

   Note: Though it is possible to specify a Content-Type value for a
   body part in a digest which is other than "message/rfc822", such as a
   "text/plain" part containing a description of the material in the



Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                    [Page 26]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


   digest, actually doing so is undesireble. The "multipart/digest"
   Content-Type is intended to be used to send collections of messages.
   If a "text/plain" part is needed, it should be included as a seperate
   part of a "multipart/mixed" message.

   A digest in this format might, then, look something like this:

     From: Moderator-Address
     To: Recipient-List
     Date: Mon, 22 Mar 1994 13:34:51 +0000
     Subject: Internet Digest, volume 42
     MIME-Version: 1.0
     Content-Type: multipart/mixed;
                   boundary="---- main boundary ----"

     ------ main boundary ----

       ...Introductory text or table of contents...

     ------ main boundary ----
     Content-Type: multipart/digest;
                   boundary="---- next message ----"

     ------ next message ----

     From: someone-else
     Date: Fri, 26 Mar 1993 11:13:32 +0200
     Subject: my opinion

       ...body goes here ...

     ------ next message ----

     From: someone-else-again
     Date: Fri, 26 Mar 1993 10:07:13 -0500
     Subject: my different opinion

       ... another body goes here ...

     ------ next message ------

     ------ main boundary ------

5.1.6.  Parallel Subtype

   This document defines a "parallel" subtype of the "multipart"
   Content-Type.  This type is syntactically identical to
   "multipart/mixed", but the semantics are different.  In particular,



Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                    [Page 27]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


   in a parallel entity, the order of body parts is not significant.

   A common presentation of this type is to display all of the parts
   simultaneously on hardware and software that are capable of doing so.
   However, composing agents should be aware that many mail readers will
   lack this capability and will show the parts serially in any event.

5.1.7.  Other Multipart Subtypes

   Other "multipart" subtypes are expected in the future.  MIME
   implementations must in general treat unrecognized subtypes of
   "multipart" as being equivalent to "multipart/mixed".

5.2.  Message Media Type

   It is frequently desirable, in sending mail, to encapsulate another
   mail message.  A special media type, "message", is defined to
   facilitate this.  In particular, the "rfc822" subtype of "message" is
   used to encapsulate RFC 822 messages.

   NOTE:  It has been suggested that subtypes of "message" might be
   defined for forwarded or rejected messages.  However, forwarded and
   rejected messages can be handled as multipart messages in which the
   first part contains any control or descriptive information, and a
   second part, of type "message/rfc822", is the forwarded or rejected
   message.  Composing rejection and forwarding messages in this manner
   will preserve the type information on the original message and allow
   it to be correctly presented to the recipient, and hence is strongly
   encouraged.

   Subtypes of "message" often impose restrictions on what encodings are
   allowed.  These restrictions are described in conjunction with each
   specific subtype.

   Mail gateways, relays, and other mail handling agents are commonly
   known to alter the top-level header of an RFC 822 message.  In
   particular, they frequently add, remove, or reorder header fields.
   These operations are explicitly forbidden for the encapsulated
   headers embedded in the bodies of messages of type "message."

5.2.1.  RFC822 Subtype

   A media type of "message/rfc822" indicates that the body contains an
   encapsulated message, with the syntax of an RFC 822 message.
   However, unlike top-level RFC 822 messages, the restriction that each
   "message/rfc822" body must include a "From", "Date", and at least one
   destination header is removed and replaced with the requirement that
   at least one of "From", "Subject", or "Date" must be present.



Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                    [Page 28]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


   It should be noted that, despite the use of the numbers "822", a
   "message/rfc822" entity isn't restricted to material in strict
   conformance to RFC822, nor are the semantics of "message/rfc822"
   objects restricted to the semantics defined in RFC822. More
   specifically, a "message/rfc822" message could well be a News article
   or a MIME message.

   No encoding other than "7bit", "8bit", or "binary" is permitted for
   the body of a "message/rfc822" entity.  The message header fields are
   always US-ASCII in any case, and data within the body can still be
   encoded, in which case the Content-Transfer-Encoding header field in
   the encapsulated message will reflect this.  Non-US-ASCII text in the
   headers of an encapsulated message can be specified using the
   mechanisms described in RFC 2047.

5.2.2.  Partial Subtype

   The "partial" subtype is defined to allow large entities to be
   delivered as several separate pieces of mail and automatically
   reassembled by a receiving user agent.  (The concept is similar to IP
   fragmentation and reassembly in the basic Internet Protocols.)  This
   mechanism can be used when intermediate transport agents limit the
   size of individual messages that can be sent.  The media type
   "message/partial" thus indicates that the body contains a fragment of
   a larger entity.

   Because data of type "message" may never be encoded in base64 or
   quoted-printable, a problem might arise if "message/partial" entities
   are constructed in an environment that supports binary or 8bit
   transport.  The problem is that the binary data would be split into
   multiple "message/partial" messages, each of them requiring binary
   transport.  If such messages were encountered at a gateway into a
   7bit transport environment, there would be no way to properly encode
   them for the 7bit world, aside from waiting for all of the fragments,
   reassembling the inner message, and then encoding the reassembled
   data in base64 or quoted-printable.  Since it is possible that
   different fragments might go through different gateways, even this is
   not an acceptable solution.  For this reason, it is specified that
   entities of type "message/partial" must always have a content-
   transfer-encoding of 7bit (the default).  In particular, even in
   environments that support binary or 8bit transport, the use of a
   content- transfer-encoding of "8bit" or "binary" is explicitly
   prohibited for MIME entities of type "message/partial". This in turn
   implies that the inner message must not use "8bit" or "binary"
   encoding.






Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                    [Page 29]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


   Because some message transfer agents may choose to automatically
   fragment large messages, and because such agents may use very
   different fragmentation thresholds, it is possible that the pieces of
   a partial message, upon reassembly, may prove themselves to comprise
   a partial message.  This is explicitly permitted.

   Three parameters must be specified in the Content-Type field of type
   "message/partial":  The first, "id", is a unique identifier, as close
   to a world-unique identifier as possible, to be used to match the
   fragments together. (In general, the identifier is essentially a
   message-id; if placed in double quotes, it can be ANY message-id, in
   accordance with the BNF for "parameter" given in RFC 2045.)  The
   second, "number", an integer, is the fragment number, which indicates
   where this fragment fits into the sequence of fragments.  The third,
   "total", another integer, is the total number of fragments.  This
   third subfield is required on the final fragment, and is optional
   (though encouraged) on the earlier fragments.  Note also that these
   parameters may be given in any order.

   Thus, the second piece of a 3-piece message may have either of the
   following header fields:

     Content-Type: Message/Partial; number=2; total=3;
                   id="oc=jpbe0M2Yt4s@thumper.bellcore.com"

     Content-Type: Message/Partial;
                   id="oc=jpbe0M2Yt4s@thumper.bellcore.com";
                   number=2

   But the third piece MUST specify the total number of fragments:

     Content-Type: Message/Partial; number=3; total=3;
                   id="oc=jpbe0M2Yt4s@thumper.bellcore.com"

   Note that fragment numbering begins with 1, not 0.

   When the fragments of an entity broken up in this manner are put
   together, the result is always a complete MIME entity, which may have
   its own Content-Type header field, and thus may contain any other
   data type.

5.2.2.1.  Message Fragmentation and Reassembly

   The semantics of a reassembled partial message must be those of the
   "inner" message, rather than of a message containing the inner
   message.  This makes it possible, for example, to send a large audio
   message as several partial messages, and still have it appear to the
   recipient as a simple audio message rather than as an encapsulated



Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                    [Page 30]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


   message containing an audio message.  That is, the encapsulation of
   the message is considered to be "transparent".

   When generating and reassembling the pieces of a "message/partial"
   message, the headers of the encapsulated message must be merged with
   the headers of the enclosing entities.  In this process the following
   rules must be observed:

    (1)   Fragmentation agents must split messages at line
          boundaries only. This restriction is imposed because
          splits at points other than the ends of lines in turn
          depends on message transports being able to preserve
          the semantics of messages that don't end with a CRLF
          sequence. Many transports are incapable of preserving
          such semantics.

    (2)   All of the header fields from the initial enclosing
          message, except those that start with "Content-" and
          the specific header fields "Subject", "Message-ID",
          "Encrypted", and "MIME-Version", must be copied, in
          order, to the new message.

    (3)   The header fields in the enclosed message which start
          with "Content-", plus the "Subject", "Message-ID",
          "Encrypted", and "MIME-Version" fields, must be
          appended, in order, to the header fields of the new
          message.  Any header fields in the enclosed message
          which do not start with "Content-" (except for the
          "Subject", "Message-ID", "Encrypted", and "MIME-
          Version" fields) will be ignored and dropped.

    (4)   All of the header fields from the second and any
          subsequent enclosing messages are discarded by the
          reassembly process.

5.2.2.2.  Fragmentation and Reassembly Example

   If an audio message is broken into two pieces, the first piece might
   look something like this:

     X-Weird-Header-1: Foo
     From: Bill@host.com
     To: joe@otherhost.com
     Date: Fri, 26 Mar 1993 12:59:38 -0500 (EST)

   and the second half might look something like this:

                   id="ABC@host.com"; number=2; total=2

       ... second half of encoded audio data goes here ...

   Then, when the fragmented message is reassembled, the resulting
   message to be displayed to the user should look something like this:

     X-Weird-Header-1: Foo
     From: Bill@host.com
     To: joe@otherhost.com

     Content-transfer-encoding: base64

       ... first half of encoded audio data goes here ...
       ... second half of encoded audio data goes here ...

   The inclusion of a "References" field in the headers of the second
   and subsequent pieces of a fragmented message that references the
   Message-Id on the previous piece may be of benefit to mail readers
   that understand and track references.  However, the generation of
   such "References" fields is entirely optional.





Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                    [Page 32]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


   Finally, it should be noted that the "Encrypted" header field has
   been made obsolete by Privacy Enhanced Messaging (PEM) [RFC-1421,
   RFC-1422, RFC-1423, RFC-1424], but the rules above are nevertheless
   believed to describe the correct way to treat it if it is encountered
   in the context of conversion to and from "message/partial" fragments.

5.2.3.  External-Body Subtype

   The external-body subtype indicates that the actual body data are not
   included, but merely referenced.  In this case, the parameters
   describe a mechanism for accessing the external data.

   When a MIME entity is of type "message/external-body", it consists of
   a header, two consecutive CRLFs, and the message header for the
   encapsulated message.  If another pair of consecutive CRLFs appears,
   this of course ends the message header for the encapsulated message.
   However, since the encapsulated message's body is itself external, it
   does NOT appear in the area that follows.  For example, consider the
   following message:

     Content-type: message/external-body;
                   access-type=local-file;
                   name="/u/nsb/Me.jpeg"

     Content-type: image/jpeg
     Content-ID: <id42@guppylake.bellcore.com>
     Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary

     THIS IS NOT REALLY THE BODY!

   The area at the end, which might be called the "phantom body", is
   ignored for most external-body messages.  However, it may be used to
   contain auxiliary information for some such messages, as indeed it is
   when the access-type is "mail- server".  The only access-type defined
   in this document that uses the phantom body is "mail-server", but
   other access-types may be defined in the future in other
   specifications that use this area.

   The encapsulated headers in ALL "message/external-body" entities MUST
   include a Content-ID header field to give a unique identifier by
   which to reference the data.  This identifier may be used for caching
   mechanisms, and for recognizing the receipt of the data when the
   access-type is "mail-server".

   Note that, as specified here, the tokens that describe external-body
   data, such as file names and mail server commands, are required to be
   in the US-ASCII character set.




Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                    [Page 33]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


   If this proves problematic in practice, a new mechanism may be
   required as a future extension to MIME, either as newly defined
   access-types for "message/external-body" or by some other mechanism.

   As with "message/partial", MIME entities of type "message/external-
   body" MUST have a content-transfer-encoding of 7bit (the default).
   In particular, even in environments that support binary or 8bit
   transport, the use of a content- transfer-encoding of "8bit" or
   "binary" is explicitly prohibited for entities of type
   "message/external-body".

5.2.3.1.  General External-Body Parameters

   The parameters that may be used with any "message/external- body"
   are:

    (1)   ACCESS-TYPE -- A word indicating the supported access
          mechanism by which the file or data may be obtained.
          This word is not case sensitive.  Values include, but
          are not limited to, "FTP", "ANON-FTP", "TFTP", "LOCAL-
          FILE", and "MAIL-SERVER".  Future values, except for
          experimental values beginning with "X-", must be
          registered with IANA, as described in RFC 2048.
          This parameter is unconditionally mandatory and MUST be
          present on EVERY "message/external-body".

    (2)   EXPIRATION -- The date (in the RFC 822 "date-time"
          syntax, as extended by RFC 1123 to permit 4 digits in
          the year field) after which the existence of the
          external data is not guaranteed.  This parameter may be
          used with ANY access-type and is ALWAYS optional.

    (3)   SIZE -- The size (in octets) of the data.  The intent
          of this parameter is to help the recipient decide
          whether or not to expend the necessary resources to
          retrieve the external data.  Note that this describes
          the size of the data in its canonical form, that is,
          before any Content-Transfer-Encoding has been applied
          or after the data have been decoded.  This parameter
          may be used with ANY access-type and is ALWAYS
          optional.

    (4)   PERMISSION -- A case-insensitive field that indicates
          whether or not it is expected that clients might also
          attempt to overwrite the data.  By default, or if
          permission is "read", the assumption is that they are
          not, and that if the data is retrieved once, it is
          never needed again.  If PERMISSION is "read-write",



Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                    [Page 34]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


          this assumption is invalid, and any local copy must be
          considered no more than a cache.  "Read" and "Read-
          write" are the only defined values of permission.  This
          parameter may be used with ANY access-type and is
          ALWAYS optional.

   The precise semantics of the access-types defined here are described
   in the sections that follow.

5.2.3.2.  The 'ftp' and 'tftp' Access-Types

   An access-type of FTP or TFTP indicates that the message body is
   accessible as a file using the FTP [RFC-959] or TFTP [RFC- 783]
   protocols, respectively.  For these access-types, the following
   additional parameters are mandatory:

    (1)   NAME -- The name of the file that contains the actual
          body data.

    (2)   SITE -- A machine from which the file may be obtained,
          using the given protocol.  This must be a fully
          qualified domain name, not a nickname.

    (3)   Before any data are retrieved, using FTP, the user will
          generally need to be asked to provide a login id and a
          password for the machine named by the site parameter.
          For security reasons, such an id and password are not
          specified as content-type parameters, but must be
          obtained from the user.

   In addition, the following parameters are optional:

    (1)   DIRECTORY -- A directory from which the data named by
          NAME should be retrieved.

    (2)   MODE -- A case-insensitive string indicating the mode
          to be used when retrieving the information.  The valid
          values for access-type "TFTP" are "NETASCII", "OCTET",
          and "MAIL", as specified by the TFTP protocol [RFC-
          783].  The valid values for access-type "FTP" are
          "ASCII", "EBCDIC", "IMAGE", and "LOCALn" where "n" is a
          decimal integer, typically 8.  These correspond to the
          representation types "A" "E" "I" and "L n" as specified
          by the FTP protocol [RFC-959].  Note that "BINARY" and
          "TENEX" are not valid values for MODE and that "OCTET"
          or "IMAGE" or "LOCAL8" should be used instead.  IF MODE
          is not specified, the  default value is "NETASCII" for
          TFTP and "ASCII" otherwise.

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


5.2.3.3.  The 'anon-ftp' Access-Type

   The "anon-ftp" access-type is identical to the "ftp" access type,
   except that the user need not be asked to provide a name and password
   for the specified site.  Instead, the ftp protocol will be used with
   login "anonymous" and a password that corresponds to the user's mail
   address.

5.2.3.4.  The 'local-file' Access-Type

   An access-type of "local-file" indicates that the actual body is
   accessible as a file on the local machine.  Two additional parameters
   are defined for this access type:

    (1)   NAME -- The name of the file that contains the actual
          body data.  This parameter is mandatory for the
          "local-file" access-type.

    (2)   SITE -- A domain specifier for a machine or set of
          machines that are known to have access to the data
          file.  This optional parameter is used to describe the
          locality of reference for the data, that is, the site
          or sites at which the file is expected to be visible.
          Asterisks may be used for wildcard matching to a part
          of a domain name, such as "*.bellcore.com", to indicate
          a set of machines on which the data should be directly
          visible, while a single asterisk may be used to
          indicate a file that is expected to be universally
          available, e.g., via a global file system.

5.2.3.5.  The 'mail-server' Access-Type

   The "mail-server" access-type indicates that the actual body is
   available from a mail server.  Two additional parameters are defined
   for this access-type:

    (1)   SERVER -- The addr-spec of the mail server from which
          the actual body data can be obtained.  This parameter
          is mandatory for the "mail-server" access-type.

    (2)   SUBJECT -- The subject that is to be used in the mail
          that is sent to obtain the data.  Note that keying mail
          servers on Subject lines is NOT recommended, but such
          mail servers are known to exist.  This is an optional
          parameter.






Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                    [Page 36]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


   Because mail servers accept a variety of syntaxes, some of which is
   multiline, the full command to be sent to a mail server is not
   included as a parameter in the content-type header field.  Instead,
   it is provided as the "phantom body" when the media type is
   "message/external-body" and the access-type is mail-server.

   Note that MIME does not define a mail server syntax.  Rather, it
   allows the inclusion of arbitrary mail server commands in the phantom
   body.  Implementations must include the phantom body in the body of
   the message it sends to the mail server address to retrieve the
   relevant data.

   Unlike other access-types, mail-server access is asynchronous and
   will happen at an unpredictable time in the future.  For this reason,
   it is important that there be a mechanism by which the returned data
   can be matched up with the original "message/external-body" entity.
   MIME mail servers must use the same Content-ID field on the returned
   message that was used in the original "message/external-body"
   entities, to facilitate such matching.

5.2.3.6.  External-Body Security Issues

   "Message/external-body" entities give rise to two important security
   issues:

    (1)   Accessing data via a "message/external-body" reference
          effectively results in the message recipient performing
          an operation that was specified by the message
          originator.  It is therefore possible for the message
          originator to trick a recipient into doing something
          they would not have done otherwise.  For example, an
          originator could specify a action that attempts
          retrieval of material that the recipient is not
          authorized to obtain, causing the recipient to
          unwittingly violate some security policy.  For this
          reason, user agents capable of resolving external
          references must always take steps to describe the
          action they are to take to the recipient and ask for
          explicit permisssion prior to performing it.

          The 'mail-server' access-type is particularly
          vulnerable, in that it causes the recipient to send a
          new message whose contents are specified by the
          original message's originator.  Given the potential for
          abuse, any such request messages that are constructed
          should contain a clear indication that they were
          generated automatically (e.g. in a Comments: header
          field) in an attempt to resolve a MIME



Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                    [Page 37]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


          "message/external-body" reference.

    (2)   MIME will sometimes be used in environments that
          provide some guarantee of message integrity and
          authenticity.  If present, such guarantees may apply
          only to the actual direct content of messages -- they
          may or may not apply to data accessed through MIME's
          "message/external-body" mechanism.  In particular, it
          may be possible to subvert certain access mechanisms
          even when the messaging system itself is secure.

          It should be noted that this problem exists either with
          or without the availabilty of MIME mechanisms.  A
          casual reference to an FTP site containing a document
          in the text of a secure message brings up similar
          issues -- the only difference is that MIME provides for
          automatic retrieval of such material, and users may
          place unwarranted trust is such automatic retrieval
          mechanisms.

5.2.3.7.  Examples and Further Explanations

   When the external-body mechanism is used in conjunction with the
   "multipart/alternative" media type it extends the functionality of
   "multipart/alternative" to include the case where the same entity is
   provided in the same format but via different accces mechanisms.
   When this is done the originator of the message must order the parts
   first in terms of preferred formats and then by preferred access
   mechanisms.  The recipient's viewer should then evaluate the list
   both in terms of format and access mechanisms.

   With the emerging possibility of very wide-area file systems, it
   becomes very hard to know in advance the set of machines where a file
   will and will not be accessible directly from the file system.
   Therefore it may make sense to provide both a file name, to be tried
   directly, and the name of one or more sites from which the file is
   known to be accessible.  An implementation can try to retrieve remote
   files using FTP or any other protocol, using anonymous file retrieval
   or prompting the user for the necessary name and password.  If an
   external body is accessible via multiple mechanisms, the sender may
   include multiple entities of type "message/external-body" within the
   body parts of an enclosing "multipart/alternative" entity.

   However, the external-body mechanism is not intended to be limited to
   file retrieval, as shown by the mail-server access-type.  Beyond
   this, one can imagine, for example, using a video server for external
   references to video clips.




Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                    [Page 38]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


   The embedded message header fields which appear in the body of the
   "message/external-body" data must be used to declare the media type
   of the external body if it is anything other than plain US-ASCII
   text, since the external body does not have a header section to
   declare its type.  Similarly, any Content-transfer-encoding other
   than "7bit" must also be declared here.  Thus a complete
   "message/external-body" message, referring to an object in PostScript
   format, might look like this:

     From: Whomever
     To: Someone
     Date: Whenever
     Subject: whatever

Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                    [Page 39]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


   Note that in the above examples, the default Content-transfer-
   encoding of "7bit" is assumed for the external postscript data.

   Like the "message/partial" type, the "message/external-body" media
   type is intended to be transparent, that is, to convey the data type
   in the external body rather than to convey a message with a body of
   that type.  Thus the headers on the outer and inner parts must be
   merged using the same rules as for "message/partial".  In particular,
   this means that the Content-type and Subject fields are overridden,
   but the From field is preserved.

   Note that since the external bodies are not transported along with
   the external body reference, they need not conform to transport
   limitations that apply to the reference itself. In particular,
   Internet mail transports may impose 7bit and line length limits, but
   these do not automatically apply to binary external body references.
   Thus a Content-Transfer-Encoding is not generally necessary, though
   it is permitted.

   Note that the body of a message of type "message/external-body" is
   governed by the basic syntax for an RFC 822 message.  In particular,
   anything before the first consecutive pair of CRLFs is header
   information, while anything after it is body information, which is
   ignored for most access-types.

5.2.4.  Other Message Subtypes

   MIME implementations must in general treat unrecognized subtypes of
   "message" as being equivalent to "application/octet-stream".

   Future subtypes of "message" intended for use with email should be
   restricted to "7bit" encoding. A type other than "message" should be
   used if restriction to "7bit" is not possible.

6.  Experimental Media Type Values

   A media type value beginning with the characters "X-" is a private
   value, to be used by consenting systems by mutual agreement.  Any
   format without a rigorous and public definition must be named with an
   "X-" prefix, and publicly specified values shall never begin with
   "X-".  (Older versions of the widely used Andrew system use the "X-
   BE2" name, so new systems should probably choose a different name.)

   In general, the use of "X-" top-level types is strongly discouraged.
   Implementors should invent subtypes of the existing types whenever
   possible. In many cases, a subtype of "application" will be more
   appropriate than a new top-level type.

7.  Summary

   The five discrete media types provide provide a standardized
   mechanism for tagging entities as "audio", "image", or several other
   kinds of data. The composite "multipart" and "message" media types
   allow mixing and hierarchical structuring of entities of different
   types in a single message. A distinguished parameter syntax allows
   further specification of data format details, particularly the
   specification of alternate character sets.  Additional optional
   header fields provide mechanisms for certain extensions deemed
   desirable by many implementors. Finally, a number of useful media
   types are defined for general use by consenting user agents, notably
   "message/partial" and "message/external-body".

9.  Security Considerations

   Security issues are discussed in the context of the
   "application/postscript" type, the "message/external-body" type, and
   in RFC 2048.  Implementors should pay special attention to the
   security implications of any media types that can cause the remote
   execution of any actions in the recipient's environment.  In such
   cases, the discussion of the "application/postscript" type may serve
   as a model for considering other media types with remote execution
   capabilities.

Appendix A -- Collected Grammar

   This appendix contains the complete BNF grammar for all the syntax
   specified by this document.

   By itself, however, this grammar is incomplete.  It refers by name to
   several syntax rules that are defined by RFC 822.  Rather than
   reproduce those definitions here, and risk unintentional differences
   between the two, this document simply refers the reader to RFC 822
   for the remaining definitions. Wherever a term is undefined, it
   refers to the RFC 822 definition.

     boundary := 0*69<bchars> bcharsnospace

     bchars := bcharsnospace / " "

     bcharsnospace := DIGIT / ALPHA / "'" / "(" / ")" /
                      "+" / "_" / "," / "-" / "." /
                      "/" / ":" / "=" / "?"

     body-part := <"message" as defined in RFC 822, with all
                   header fields optional, not starting with the
                   specified dash-boundary, and with the
                   delimiter not occurring anywhere in the
                   body part.  Note that the semantics of a
                   part differ from the semantics of a message,
                   as described in the text.>

     close-delimiter := delimiter "--"

     dash-boundary := "--" boundary
                      ; boundary taken from the value of
                      ; boundary parameter of the
                      ; Content-Type field.

     delimiter := CRLF dash-boundary

     discard-text := *(*text CRLF)
                     ; May be ignored or discarded.

     encapsulation := delimiter transport-padding
                      CRLF body-part

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


1.  Introduction

   The comma separated values format (CSV) has been used for exchanging
   and converting data between various spreadsheet programs for quite
   some time.  Surprisingly, while this format is very common, it has
   never been formally documented.  Additionally, while the IANA MIME
   registration tree includes a registration for
   "text/tab-separated-values" type, no MIME types have ever been
   registered with IANA for CSV.  At the same time, various programs and
   operating systems have begun to use different MIME types for this
   format.  This RFC documents the format of comma separated values
   (CSV) files and formally registers the "text/csv" MIME type for CSV
   in accordance with RFC 2048 [1].

2.  Definition of the CSV Format

   While there are various specifications and implementations for the
   CSV format (for ex. [4], [5], [6] and [7]), there is no formal
   specification in existence, which allows for a wide variety of
   interpretations of CSV files.  This section documents the format that
   seems to be followed by most implementations:

   1.  Each record is located on a separate line, delimited by a line
       break (CRLF).  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF

   2.  The last record in the file may or may not have an ending line
       break.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   3.  There maybe an optional header line appearing as the first line
       of the file with the same format as normal record lines.  This
       header will contain names corresponding to the fields in the file
       and should contain the same number of fields as the records in
       the rest of the file (the presence or absence of the header line
       should be indicated via the optional "header" parameter of this
       MIME type).  For example:

       field_name,field_name,field_name CRLF
       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF






Shafranovich                 Informational                      [Page 2]

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


   4.  Within the header and each record, there may be one or more
       fields, separated by commas.  Each line should contain the same
       number of fields throughout the file.  Spaces are considered part
       of a field and should not be ignored.  The last field in the
       record must not be followed by a comma.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc

   5.  Each field may or may not be enclosed in double quotes (however
       some programs, such as Microsoft Excel, do not use double quotes
       at all).  If fields are not enclosed with double quotes, then
       double quotes may not appear inside the fields.  For example:

       "aaa","bbb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   6.  Fields containing line breaks (CRLF), double quotes, and commas
       should be enclosed in double-quotes.  For example:

       "aaa","b CRLF
       bb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   7.  If double-quotes are used to enclose fields, then a double-quote
       appearing inside a field must be escaped by preceding it with
       another double quote.  For example:

       "aaa","b""bb","ccc"

   The ABNF grammar [2] appears as follows:

   file = [header CRLF] record *(CRLF record) [CRLF]

   header = name *(COMMA name)

   record = field *(COMMA field)

   name = field

   field = (escaped / non-escaped)

   escaped = DQUOTE *(TEXTDATA / COMMA / CR / LF / 2DQUOTE) DQUOTE

   non-escaped = *TEXTDATA

   COMMA = %x2C

   CR = %x0D ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


   DQUOTE =  %x22 ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   LF = %x0A ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   CRLF = CR LF ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   TEXTDATA =  %x20-21 / %x23-2B / %x2D-7E

3.  MIME Type Registration of text/csv

   This section provides the media-type registration application (as per
   RFC 2048 [1].

   To: ietf-types@iana.org

   Subject: Registration of MIME media type text/csv

   MIME media type name: text

   MIME subtype name: csv

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: charset, header

      Common usage of CSV is US-ASCII, but other character sets defined
      by IANA for the "text" tree may be used in conjunction with the
      "charset" parameter.

      The "header" parameter indicates the presence or absence of the
      header line.  Valid values are "present" or "absent".
      Implementors choosing not to use this parameter must make their
      own decisions as to whether the header line is present or absent.

   Encoding considerations:

      As per section 4.1.1. of RFC 2046 [3], this media type uses CRLF
      to denote line breaks.  However, implementors should be aware that
      some implementations may use other values.

   Security considerations:

      CSV files contain passive text data that should not pose any
      risks.  However, it is possible in theory that malicious binary
      data may be included in order to exploit potential buffer overruns
      in the program processing CSV data.  Additionally, private data
      may be shared via this format (which of course applies to any text
      data).

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


   Interoperability considerations:

      Due to lack of a single specification, there are considerable
      differences among implementations.  Implementors should "be
      conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from
      others" (RFC 793 [8]) when processing CSV files.  An attempt at a
      common definition can be found in Section 2.

      Implementations deciding not to use the optional "header"
      parameter must make their own decision as to whether the header is
      absent or present.

   Published specification:

      While numerous private specifications exist for various programs
      and systems, there is no single "master" specification for this
      format.  An attempt at a common definition can be found in Section
      2.

   Applications that use this media type:

      Spreadsheet programs and various data conversion utilities

   Additional information:

      Magic number(s): none

      File extension(s): CSV

      Macintosh File Type Code(s): TEXT

                                PREFACE



This document describes the DoD Standard Transmission Control Protocol
(TCP).  There have been nine earlier editions of the ARPA TCP
specification on which this standard is based, and the present text
draws heavily from them.  There have been many contributors to this work
both in terms of concepts and in terms of text.  This edition clarifies
several details and removes the end-of-letter buffer-size adjustments,
and redescribes the letter mechanism as a push function.

                     TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL

                         DARPA INTERNET PROGRAM
                         PROTOCOL SPECIFICATION



                            1.  INTRODUCTION

The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is intended for use as a highly
reliable host-to-host protocol between hosts in packet-switched computer
communication networks, and in interconnected systems of such networks.

This document describes the functions to be performed by the
Transmission Control Protocol, the program that implements it, and its
interface to programs or users that require its services.

1.1.  Motivation

  Computer communication systems are playing an increasingly important
  role in military, government, and civilian environments.  This
  document focuses its attention primarily on military computer
  communication requirements, especially robustness in the presence of
  communication unreliability and availability in the presence of
  congestion, but many of these problems are found in the civilian and
  government sector as well.

  As strategic and tactical computer communication networks are
  developed and deployed, it is essential to provide means of
  interconnecting them and to provide standard interprocess
  communication protocols which can support a broad range of
  applications.  In anticipation of the need for such standards, the
  Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering has
  declared the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) described herein to
  be a basis for DoD-wide inter-process communication protocol
  standardization.

  TCP is a connection-oriented, end-to-end reliable protocol designed to
  fit into a layered hierarchy of protocols which support multi-network
  applications.  The TCP provides for reliable inter-process
  communication between pairs of processes in host computers attached to
  distinct but interconnected computer communication networks.  Very few
  assumptions are made as to the reliability of the communication
  protocols below the TCP layer.  TCP assumes it can obtain a simple,
  potentially unreliable datagram service from the lower level
  protocols.  In principle, the TCP should be able to operate above a

Transmission Control Protocol
Introduction



  TCP is based on concepts first described by Cerf and Kahn in [1].  The
  TCP fits into a layered protocol architecture just above a basic
  Internet Protocol [2] which provides a way for the TCP to send and
  receive variable-length segments of information enclosed in internet
  datagram "envelopes".  The internet datagram provides a means for
  addressing source and destination TCPs in different networks.  The
  internet protocol also deals with any fragmentation or reassembly of
  the TCP segments required to achieve transport and delivery through
  multiple networks and interconnecting gateways.  The internet protocol
  also carries information on the precedence, security classification
  and compartmentation of the TCP segments, so this information can be
  communicated end-to-end across multiple networks.

  Much of this document is written in the context of TCP implementations
  which are co-resident with higher level protocols in the host
  computer.  Some computer systems will be connected to networks via
  front-end computers which house the TCP and internet protocol layers,
  as well as network specific software.  The TCP specification describes
  an interface to the higher level protocols which appears to be
  implementable even for the front-end case, as long as a suitable
  host-to-front end protocol is implemented.

1.2.  Scope

  The TCP is intended to provide a reliable process-to-process
  communication service in a multinetwork environment.  The TCP is
  intended to be a host-to-host protocol in common use in multiple
  networks.

1.3.  About this Document

  This document represents a specification of the behavior required of
  any TCP implementation, both in its interactions with higher level
  protocols and in its interactions with other TCPs.  The rest of this

  section offers a very brief view of the protocol interfaces and
  operation.  Section 2 summarizes the philosophical basis for the TCP
  design.  Section 3 offers both a detailed description of the actions
  required of TCP when various events occur (arrival of new segments,
  user calls, errors, etc.) and the details of the formats of TCP
  segments.

1.4.  Interfaces

  The TCP interfaces on one side to user or application processes and on
  the other side to a lower level protocol such as Internet Protocol.

  The interface between an application process and the TCP is
  illustrated in reasonable detail.  This interface consists of a set of
  calls much like the calls an operating system provides to an
  application process for manipulating files.  For example, there are
  calls to open and close connections and to send and receive data on
  established connections.  It is also expected that the TCP can
  asynchronously communicate with application programs.  Although
  considerable freedom is permitted to TCP implementors to design
  interfaces which are appropriate to a particular operating system
  environment, a minimum functionality is required at the TCP/user
  interface for any valid implementation.

  The interface between TCP and lower level protocol is essentially
  unspecified except that it is assumed there is a mechanism whereby the
  two levels can asynchronously pass information to each other.
  Typically, one expects the lower level protocol to specify this
  interface.  TCP is designed to work in a very general environment of
  interconnected networks.  The lower level protocol which is assumed
  throughout this document is the Internet Protocol [2].

1.5.  Operation

  As noted above, the primary purpose of the TCP is to provide reliable,
  securable logical circuit or connection service between pairs of
  processes.  To provide this service on top of a less reliable internet
  communication system requires facilities in the following areas:

    Basic Data Transfer
    Reliability
    Flow Control
    Multiplexing
    Connections
    Precedence and Security

  The basic operation of the TCP in each of these areas is described in
  the following paragraphs.

Transmission Control Protocol
Introduction



  Basic Data Transfer:

    The TCP is able to transfer a continuous stream of octets in each
    direction between its users by packaging some number of octets into
    segments for transmission through the internet system.  In general,
    the TCPs decide when to block and forward data at their own
    convenience.

    Sometimes users need to be sure that all the data they have
    submitted to the TCP has been transmitted.  For this purpose a push
    function is defined.  To assure that data submitted to a TCP is
    actually transmitted the sending user indicates that it should be
    pushed through to the receiving user.  A push causes the TCPs to
    promptly forward and deliver data up to that point to the receiver.
    The exact push point might not be visible to the receiving user and
    the push function does not supply a record boundary marker.

  Reliability:

    The TCP must recover from data that is damaged, lost, duplicated, or
    delivered out of order by the internet communication system.  This
    is achieved by assigning a sequence number to each octet
    transmitted, and requiring a positive acknowledgment (ACK) from the
    receiving TCP.  If the ACK is not received within a timeout
    interval, the data is retransmitted.  At the receiver, the sequence
    numbers are used to correctly order segments that may be received
    out of order and to eliminate duplicates.  Damage is handled by
    adding a checksum to each segment transmitted, checking it at the
    receiver, and discarding damaged segments.

    As long as the TCPs continue to function properly and the internet
    system does not become completely partitioned, no transmission
    errors will affect the correct delivery of data.  TCP recovers from
    internet communication system errors.

  Flow Control:

    TCP provides a means for the receiver to govern the amount of data
    sent by the sender.  This is achieved by returning a "window" with
    every ACK indicating a range of acceptable sequence numbers beyond
    the last segment successfully received.  The window indicates an
    allowed number of octets that the sender may transmit before
    receiving further permission.

                                                            Introduction



  Multiplexing:

    To allow for many processes within a single Host to use TCP
    communication facilities simultaneously, the TCP provides a set of
    addresses or ports within each host.  Concatenated with the network
    and host addresses from the internet communication layer, this forms
    a socket.  A pair of sockets uniquely identifies each connection.
    That is, a socket may be simultaneously used in multiple
    connections.

    The binding of ports to processes is handled independently by each
    Host.  However, it proves useful to attach frequently used processes
    (e.g., a "logger" or timesharing service) to fixed sockets which are
    made known to the public.  These services can then be accessed
    through the known addresses.  Establishing and learning the port
    addresses of other processes may involve more dynamic mechanisms.

  Connections:

    The reliability and flow control mechanisms described above require
    that TCPs initialize and maintain certain status information for
    each data stream.  The combination of this information, including
    sockets, sequence numbers, and window sizes, is called a connection.
    Each connection is uniquely specified by a pair of sockets
    identifying its two sides.

    When two processes wish to communicate, their TCP's must first
    establish a connection (initialize the status information on each
    side).  When their communication is complete, the connection is
    terminated or closed to free the resources for other uses.

    Since connections must be established between unreliable hosts and
    over the unreliable internet communication system, a handshake
    mechanism with clock-based sequence numbers is used to avoid
    erroneous initialization of connections.

  Precedence and Security:

    The users of TCP may indicate the security and precedence of their
    communication.  Provision is made for default values to be used when
    these features are not needed.

                             2.  PHILOSOPHY

2.1.  Elements of the Internetwork System

  The internetwork environment consists of hosts connected to networks
  which are in turn interconnected via gateways.  It is assumed here
  that the networks may be either local networks (e.g., the ETHERNET) or
  large networks (e.g., the ARPANET), but in any case are based on
  packet switching technology.  The active agents that produce and
  consume messages are processes.  Various levels of protocols in the
  networks, the gateways, and the hosts support an interprocess
  communication system that provides two-way data flow on logical
  connections between process ports.

  The term packet is used generically here to mean the data of one
  transaction between a host and its network.  The format of data blocks
  exchanged within the a network will generally not be of concern to us.

  Hosts are computers attached to a network, and from the communication
  network's point of view, are the sources and destinations of packets.
  Processes are viewed as the active elements in host computers (in
  accordance with the fairly common definition of a process as a program
  in execution).  Even terminals and files or other I/O devices are
  viewed as communicating with each other through the use of processes.
  Thus, all communication is viewed as inter-process communication.

  Since a process may need to distinguish among several communication
  streams between itself and another process (or processes), we imagine
  that each process may have a number of ports through which it
  communicates with the ports of other processes.

2.2.  Model of Operation

  Processes transmit data by calling on the TCP and passing buffers of
  data as arguments.  The TCP packages the data from these buffers into
  segments and calls on the internet module to transmit each segment to
  the destination TCP.  The receiving TCP places the data from a segment
  into the receiving user's buffer and notifies the receiving user.  The
  TCPs include control information in the segments which they use to
  ensure reliable ordered data transmission.

  The model of internet communication is that there is an internet
  protocol module associated with each TCP which provides an interface
  to the local network.  This internet module packages TCP segments
  inside internet datagrams and routes these datagrams to a destination
  internet module or intermediate gateway.  To transmit the datagram
  through the local network, it is embedded in a local network packet.

  The packet switches may perform further packaging, fragmentation, or


                                                                [Page 7]

                                                          September 1981

Philosophy



  other operations to achieve the delivery of the local packet to the
  destination internet module.

  At a gateway between networks, the internet datagram is "unwrapped"
  from its local packet and examined to determine through which network
  the internet datagram should travel next.  The internet datagram is
  then "wrapped" in a local packet suitable to the next network and
  routed to the next gateway, or to the final destination.

  A gateway is permitted to break up an internet datagram into smaller
  internet datagram fragments if this is necessary for transmission
  through the next network.  To do this, the gateway produces a set of
  internet datagrams; each carrying a fragment.  Fragments may be
  further broken into smaller fragments at subsequent gateways.  The
  internet datagram fragment format is designed so that the destination
  internet module can reassemble fragments into internet datagrams.

  A destination internet module unwraps the segment from the datagram
  (after reassembling the datagram, if necessary) and passes it to the
  destination TCP.

  This simple model of the operation glosses over many details.  One
  important feature is the type of service.  This provides information
  to the gateway (or internet module) to guide it in selecting the
  service parameters to be used in traversing the next network.
  Included in the type of service information is the precedence of the
  datagram.  Datagrams may also carry security information to permit
  host and gateways that operate in multilevel secure environments to
  properly segregate datagrams for security considerations.

2.3.  The Host Environment

  The TCP is assumed to be a module in an operating system.  The users
  access the TCP much like they would access the file system.  The TCP
  may call on other operating system functions, for example, to manage
  data structures.  The actual interface to the network is assumed to be
  controlled by a device driver module.  The TCP does not call on the
  network device driver directly, but rather calls on the internet
  datagram protocol module which may in turn call on the device driver.

  The mechanisms of TCP do not preclude implementation of the TCP in a
  front-end processor.  However, in such an implementation, a
  host-to-front-end protocol must provide the functionality to support
  the type of TCP-user interface described in this document.

2.4.  Interfaces

  The TCP/user interface provides for calls made by the user on the TCP
  to OPEN or CLOSE a connection, to SEND or RECEIVE data, or to obtain
  STATUS about a connection.  These calls are like other calls from user
  programs on the operating system, for example, the calls to open, read
  from, and close a file.

  The TCP/internet interface provides calls to send and receive
  datagrams addressed to TCP modules in hosts anywhere in the internet
  system.  These calls have parameters for passing the address, type of
  service, precedence, security, and other control information.

2.5.  Relation to Other Protocols

  The following diagram illustrates the place of the TCP in the protocol
  hierarchy:

                         Protocol Relationships

                               Figure 2.

  It is expected that the TCP will be able to support higher level
  protocols efficiently.  It should be easy to interface higher level
  protocols like the ARPANET Telnet or AUTODIN II THP to the TCP.

2.6.  Reliable Communication

  A stream of data sent on a TCP connection is delivered reliably and in
  order at the destination.



                                                                [Page 9]

Transmission Control Protocol
Philosophy



  Transmission is made reliable via the use of sequence numbers and
  acknowledgments.  Conceptually, each octet of data is assigned a
  sequence number.  The sequence number of the first octet of data in a
  segment is transmitted with that segment and is called the segment
  sequence number.  Segments also carry an acknowledgment number which
  is the sequence number of the next expected data octet of
  transmissions in the reverse direction.  When the TCP transmits a
  segment containing data, it puts a copy on a retransmission queue and
  starts a timer; when the acknowledgment for that data is received, the
  segment is deleted from the queue.  If the acknowledgment is not
  received before the timer runs out, the segment is retransmitted.

  An acknowledgment by TCP does not guarantee that the data has been
  delivered to the end user, but only that the receiving TCP has taken
  the responsibility to do so.

  To govern the flow of data between TCPs, a flow control mechanism is
  employed.  The receiving TCP reports a "window" to the sending TCP.
  This window specifies the number of octets, starting with the
  acknowledgment number, that the receiving TCP is currently prepared to
  receive.

2.7.  Connection Establishment and Clearing

  To identify the separate data streams that a TCP may handle, the TCP
  provides a port identifier.  Since port identifiers are selected
  independently by each TCP they might not be unique.  To provide for
  unique addresses within each TCP, we concatenate an internet address
  identifying the TCP with a port identifier to create a socket which
  will be unique throughout all networks connected together.

  A connection is fully specified by the pair of sockets at the ends.  A
  local socket may participate in many connections to different foreign
  sockets.  A connection can be used to carry data in both directions,
  that is, it is "full duplex".

  TCPs are free to associate ports with processes however they choose.
  However, several basic concepts are necessary in any implementation.
  There must be well-known sockets which the TCP associates only with
  the "appropriate" processes by some means.  We envision that processes
  may "own" ports, and that processes can initiate connections only on
  the ports they own.  (Means for implementing ownership is a local
  issue, but we envision a Request Port user command, or a method of
  uniquely allocating a group of ports to a given process, e.g., by
  associating the high order bits of a port name with a given process.)

  A connection is specified in the OPEN call by the local port and
  foreign socket arguments.  In return, the TCP supplies a (short) local

  connection name by which the user refers to the connection in
  subsequent calls.  There are several things that must be remembered
  about a connection.  To store this information we imagine that there
  is a data structure called a Transmission Control Block (TCB).  One
  implementation strategy would have the local connection name be a
  pointer to the TCB for this connection.  The OPEN call also specifies
  whether the connection establishment is to be actively pursued, or to
  be passively waited for.

  A passive OPEN request means that the process wants to accept incoming
  connection requests rather than attempting to initiate a connection.
  Often the process requesting a passive OPEN will accept a connection
  request from any caller.  In this case a foreign socket of all zeros
  is used to denote an unspecified socket.  Unspecified foreign sockets
  are allowed only on passive OPENs.

  A service process that wished to provide services for unknown other
  processes would issue a passive OPEN request with an unspecified
  foreign socket.  Then a connection could be made with any process that
  requested a connection to this local socket.  It would help if this
  local socket were known to be associated with this service.

  Well-known sockets are a convenient mechanism for a priori associating
  a socket address with a standard service.  For instance, the
  "Telnet-Server" process is permanently assigned to a particular
  socket, and other sockets are reserved for File Transfer, Remote Job
  Entry, Text Generator, Echoer, and Sink processes (the last three
  being for test purposes).  A socket address might be reserved for
  access to a "Look-Up" service which would return the specific socket
  at which a newly created service would be provided.  The concept of a
  well-known socket is part of the TCP specification, but the assignment
  of sockets to services is outside this specification.  (See [4].)

  Processes can issue passive OPENs and wait for matching active OPENs
  from other processes and be informed by the TCP when connections have
  been established.  Two processes which issue active OPENs to each
  other at the same time will be correctly connected.  This flexibility
  is critical for the support of distributed computing in which
  components act asynchronously with respect to each other.

  There are two principal cases for matching the sockets in the local
  passive OPENs and an foreign active OPENs.  In the first case, the
  local passive OPENs has fully specified the foreign socket.  In this
  case, the match must be exact.  In the second case, the local passive
  OPENs has left the foreign socket unspecified.  In this case, any
  foreign socket is acceptable as long as the local sockets match.
  Other possibilities include partially restricted matches.



                                                               [Page 11]

Transmission Control Protocol
Philosophy



  If there are several pending passive OPENs (recorded in TCBs) with the
  same local socket, an foreign active OPEN will be matched to a TCB
  with the specific foreign socket in the foreign active OPEN, if such a
  TCB exists, before selecting a TCB with an unspecified foreign socket.

  The procedures to establish connections utilize the synchronize (SYN)
  control flag and involves an exchange of three messages.  This
  exchange has been termed a three-way hand shake [3].

  A connection is initiated by the rendezvous of an arriving segment
  containing a SYN and a waiting TCB entry each created by a user OPEN
  command.  The matching of local and foreign sockets determines when a
  connection has been initiated.  The connection becomes "established"
  when sequence numbers have been synchronized in both directions.

  The clearing of a connection also involves the exchange of segments,
  in this case carrying the FIN control flag.

2.8.  Data Communication

  The data that flows on a connection may be thought of as a stream of
  octets.  The sending user indicates in each SEND call whether the data
  in that call (and any preceeding calls) should be immediately pushed
  through to the receiving user by the setting of the PUSH flag.

  A sending TCP is allowed to collect data from the sending user and to
  send that data in segments at its own convenience, until the push
  function is signaled, then it must send all unsent data.  When a
  receiving TCP sees the PUSH flag, it must not wait for more data from
  the sending TCP before passing the data to the receiving process.

  There is no necessary relationship between push functions and segment
  boundaries.  The data in any particular segment may be the result of a
  single SEND call, in whole or part, or of multiple SEND calls.

  The purpose of push function and the PUSH flag is to push data through
  from the sending user to the receiving user.  It does not provide a
  record service.

  There is a coupling between the push function and the use of buffers
  of data that cross the TCP/user interface.  Each time a PUSH flag is
  associated with data placed into the receiving user's buffer, the
  buffer is returned to the user for processing even if the buffer is
  not filled.  If data arrives that fills the user's buffer before a
  PUSH is seen, the data is passed to the user in buffer size units.

  TCP also provides a means to communicate to the receiver of data that
  at some point further along in the data stream than the receiver is

  currently reading there is urgent data.  TCP does not attempt to
  define what the user specifically does upon being notified of pending
  urgent data, but the general notion is that the receiving process will
  take action to process the urgent data quickly.

2.9.  Precedence and Security

  The TCP makes use of the internet protocol type of service field and
  security option to provide precedence and security on a per connection
  basis to TCP users.  Not all TCP modules will necessarily function in
  a multilevel secure environment; some may be limited to unclassified
  use only, and others may operate at only one security level and
  compartment.  Consequently, some TCP implementations and services to
  users may be limited to a subset of the multilevel secure case.

  TCP modules which operate in a multilevel secure environment must
  properly mark outgoing segments with the security, compartment, and
  precedence.  Such TCP modules must also provide to their users or
  higher level protocols such as Telnet or THP an interface to allow
  them to specify the desired security level, compartment, and
  precedence of connections.

2.10.  Robustness Principle

  TCP implementations will follow a general principle of robustness:  be
  conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from

                      3.  FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATION

3.1.  Header Format

  TCP segments are sent as internet datagrams.  The Internet Protocol
  header carries several information fields, including the source and
  destination host addresses [2].  A TCP header follows the internet
  header, supplying information specific to the TCP protocol.  This
  division allows for the existence of host level protocols other than
  TCP.

          Note that one tick mark represents one bit position.

                               Figure 3.

  Source Port:  16 bits

    The source port number.

  Destination Port:  16 bits

    The destination port number.

Transmission Control Protocol
Functional Specification



  Sequence Number:  32 bits

    The sequence number of the first data octet in this segment (except
    when SYN is present). If SYN is present the sequence number is the
    initial sequence number (ISN) and the first data octet is ISN+1.

  Acknowledgment Number:  32 bits

    If the ACK control bit is set this field contains the value of the
    next sequence number the sender of the segment is expecting to
    receive.  Once a connection is established this is always sent.

  Data Offset:  4 bits

    The number of 32 bit words in the TCP Header.  This indicates where
    the data begins.  The TCP header (even one including options) is an
    integral number of 32 bits long.

  Reserved:  6 bits

    Reserved for future use.  Must be zero.

  Control Bits:  6 bits (from left to right):

    URG:  Urgent Pointer field significant
    ACK:  Acknowledgment field significant
    PSH:  Push Function
    RST:  Reset the connection
    SYN:  Synchronize sequence numbers
    FIN:  No more data from sender

  Window:  16 bits

    The number of data octets beginning with the one indicated in the
    acknowledgment field which the sender of this segment is willing to
    accept.

  Checksum:  16 bits

    The checksum field is the 16 bit one's complement of the one's
    complement sum of all 16 bit words in the header and text.  If a
    segment contains an odd number of header and text octets to be
    checksummed, the last octet is padded on the right with zeros to
    form a 16 bit word for checksum purposes.  The pad is not
    transmitted as part of the segment.  While computing the checksum,
    the checksum field itself is replaced with zeros.

    The checksum also covers a 96 bit pseudo header conceptually

    prefixed to the TCP header.  This pseudo header contains the Source
    Address, the Destination Address, the Protocol, and TCP length.
    This gives the TCP protection against misrouted segments.  This
    information is carried in the Internet Protocol and is transferred
    across the TCP/Network interface in the arguments or results of
    calls by the TCP on the IP.

                     +--------+--------+--------+--------+
                     |           Source Address          |
                     +--------+--------+--------+--------+
                     |         Destination Address       |
                     +--------+--------+--------+--------+
                     |  zero  |  PTCL  |    TCP Length   |
                     +--------+--------+--------+--------+

      The TCP Length is the TCP header length plus the data length in
      octets (this is not an explicitly transmitted quantity, but is
      computed), and it does not count the 12 octets of the pseudo
      header.

  Urgent Pointer:  16 bits

    This field communicates the current value of the urgent pointer as a
    positive offset from the sequence number in this segment.  The
    urgent pointer points to the sequence number of the octet following
    the urgent data.  This field is only be interpreted in segments with
    the URG control bit set.

  Options:  variable

    Options may occupy space at the end of the TCP header and are a
    multiple of 8 bits in length.  All options are included in the
    checksum.  An option may begin on any octet boundary.  There are two
    cases for the format of an option:

      Case 1:  A single octet of option-kind.

      Case 2:  An octet of option-kind, an octet of option-length, and
               the actual option-data octets.

    The option-length counts the two octets of option-kind and
    option-length as well as the option-data octets.

    Note that the list of options may be shorter than the data offset
    field might imply.  The content of the header beyond the
    End-of-Option option must be header padding (i.e., zero).

    A TCP must implement all options.


                                                               [Page 17]

    Currently defined options include (kind indicated in octal):

        +--------+
        |00000000|
        +--------+
         Kind=0

        This option code indicates the end of the option list.  This
        might not coincide with the end of the TCP header according to
        the Data Offset field.  This is used at the end of all options,
        not the end of each option, and need only be used if the end of
        the options would not otherwise coincide with the end of the TCP
        header.

      No-Operation

        +--------+
        |00000001|
        +--------+
         Kind=1

        This option code may be used between options, for example, to
        align the beginning of a subsequent option on a word boundary.
        There is no guarantee that senders will use this option, so
        receivers must be prepared to process options even if they do
        not begin on a word boundary.

        Maximum Segment Size Option Data:  16 bits

          If this option is present, then it communicates the maximum
          receive segment size at the TCP which sends this segment.
          This field must only be sent in the initial connection request
          (i.e., in segments with the SYN control bit set).  If this
          option is not used, any segment size is allowed.

  Padding:  variable

    The TCP header padding is used to ensure that the TCP header ends
    and data begins on a 32 bit boundary.  The padding is composed of
    zeros.

3.2.  Terminology

  Before we can discuss very much about the operation of the TCP we need
  to introduce some detailed terminology.  The maintenance of a TCP
  connection requires the remembering of several variables.  We conceive
  of these variables being stored in a connection record called a
  Transmission Control Block or TCB.  Among the variables stored in the
  TCB are the local and remote socket numbers, the security and
  precedence of the connection, pointers to the user's send and receive
  buffers, pointers to the retransmit queue and to the current segment.
  In addition several variables relating to the send and receive
  sequence numbers are stored in the TCB.

    Send Sequence Variables

      SND.UNA - send unacknowledged
      SND.NXT - send next
      SND.WND - send window
      SND.UP  - send urgent pointer
      SND.WL1 - segment sequence number used for last window update
      SND.WL2 - segment acknowledgment number used for last window
                update
      ISS     - initial send sequence number

    Receive Sequence Variables

      RCV.NXT - receive next
      RCV.WND - receive window
      RCV.UP  - receive urgent pointer
      IRS     - initial receive sequence number

  The following diagrams may help to relate some of these variables to
  the sequence space.

  take their values from the fields of the current segment.

    Current Segment Variables

      SEG.SEQ - segment sequence number
      SEG.ACK - segment acknowledgment number
      SEG.LEN - segment length
      SEG.WND - segment window
      SEG.UP  - segment urgent pointer
      SEG.PRC - segment precedence value

  A connection progresses through a series of states during its
  lifetime.  The states are:  LISTEN, SYN-SENT, SYN-RECEIVED,
  ESTABLISHED, FIN-WAIT-1, FIN-WAIT-2, CLOSE-WAIT, CLOSING, LAST-ACK,
  TIME-WAIT, and the fictional state CLOSED.  CLOSED is fictional
  because it represents the state when there is no TCB, and therefore,
  no connection.  Briefly the meanings of the states are:

    LISTEN - represents waiting for a connection request from any remote
    TCP and port.

    SYN-SENT - represents waiting for a matching connection request
    after having sent a connection request.

    SYN-RECEIVED - represents waiting for a confirming connection
    request acknowledgment after having both received and sent a
    connection request.

    ESTABLISHED - represents an open connection, data received can be
    delivered to the user.  The normal state for the data transfer phase
    of the connection.

    FIN-WAIT-1 - represents waiting for a connection termination request
    from the remote TCP, or an acknowledgment of the connection
    termination request previously sent.

    FIN-WAIT-2 - represents waiting for a connection termination request
    from the remote TCP.

    CLOSE-WAIT - represents waiting for a connection termination request
    from the local user.

    CLOSING - represents waiting for a connection termination request
    acknowledgment from the remote TCP.

    LAST-ACK - represents waiting for an acknowledgment of the
    connection termination request previously sent to the remote TCP
    (which includes an acknowledgment of its connection termination
    request).



                                                               [Page 21]

Transmission Control Protocol
Functional Specification



    TIME-WAIT - represents waiting for enough time to pass to be sure
    the remote TCP received the acknowledgment of its connection
    termination request.

    CLOSED - represents no connection state at all.

  A TCP connection progresses from one state to another in response to
  events.  The events are the user calls, OPEN, SEND, RECEIVE, CLOSE,
  ABORT, and STATUS; the incoming segments, particularly those
  containing the SYN, ACK, RST and FIN flags; and timeouts.

  The state diagram in figure 6 illustrates only state changes, together
  with the causing events and resulting actions, but addresses neither
  error conditions nor actions which are not connected with state
  changes.  In a later section, more detail is offered with respect to
  the reaction of the TCP to events.

  NOTE BENE:  this diagram is only a summary and must not be taken as
  the total specification.

3.3.  Sequence Numbers

  A fundamental notion in the design is that every octet of data sent
  over a TCP connection has a sequence number.  Since every octet is
  sequenced, each of them can be acknowledged.  The acknowledgment
  mechanism employed is cumulative so that an acknowledgment of sequence
  number X indicates that all octets up to but not including X have been
  received.  This mechanism allows for straight-forward duplicate
  detection in the presence of retransmission.  Numbering of octets
  within a segment is that the first data octet immediately following
  the header is the lowest numbered, and the following octets are
  numbered consecutively.

  It is essential to remember that the actual sequence number space is
  finite, though very large.  This space ranges from 0 to 2**32 - 1.
  Since the space is finite, all arithmetic dealing with sequence
  numbers must be performed modulo 2**32.  This unsigned arithmetic
  preserves the relationship of sequence numbers as they cycle from
  2**32 - 1 to 0 again.  There are some subtleties to computer modulo
  arithmetic, so great care should be taken in programming the
  comparison of such values.  The symbol "=<" means "less than or equal"
  (modulo 2**32).

  The typical kinds of sequence number comparisons which the TCP must
  perform include:

    (a)  Determining that an acknowledgment refers to some sequence
         number sent but not yet acknowledged.

    (b)  Determining that all sequence numbers occupied by a segment
         have been acknowledged (e.g., to remove the segment from a
         retransmission queue).

    (c)  Determining that an incoming segment contains sequence numbers
         which are expected (i.e., that the segment "overlaps" the
         receive window).

  In response to sending data the TCP will receive acknowledgments.  The
  following comparisons are needed to process the acknowledgments.

    SND.UNA = oldest unacknowledged sequence number

    SND.NXT = next sequence number to be sent

    SEG.ACK = acknowledgment from the receiving TCP (next sequence
              number expected by the receiving TCP)

    SEG.SEQ = first sequence number of a segment

    SEG.LEN = the number of octets occupied by the data in the segment
              (counting SYN and FIN)

    SEG.SEQ+SEG.LEN-1 = last sequence number of a segment

  A new acknowledgment (called an "acceptable ack"), is one for which
  the inequality below holds:

    SND.UNA < SEG.ACK =< SND.NXT

  A segment on the retransmission queue is fully acknowledged if the sum
  of its sequence number and length is less or equal than the
  acknowledgment value in the incoming segment.

  When data is received the following comparisons are needed:

    RCV.NXT = next sequence number expected on an incoming segments, and
        is the left or lower edge of the receive window

    RCV.NXT+RCV.WND-1 = last sequence number expected on an incoming
        segment, and is the right or upper edge of the receive window

    SEG.SEQ = first sequence number occupied by the incoming segment

    SEG.SEQ+SEG.LEN-1 = last sequence number occupied by the incoming
        segment

  A segment is judged to occupy a portion of valid receive sequence
  space if

    RCV.NXT =< SEG.SEQ < RCV.NXT+RCV.WND

  or

    RCV.NXT =< SEG.SEQ+SEG.LEN-1 < RCV.NXT+RCV.WND

  The first part of this test checks to see if the beginning of the
  segment falls in the window, the second part of the test checks to see
  if the end of the segment falls in the window; if the segment passes
  either part of the test it contains data in the window.

  Actually, it is a little more complicated than this.  Due to zero
  windows and zero length segments, we have four cases for the
  acceptability of an incoming segment:

    Segment Receive  Test
    Length  Window
    ------- -------  -------------------------------------------

       0       0     SEG.SEQ = RCV.NXT

       0      >0     RCV.NXT =< SEG.SEQ < RCV.NXT+RCV.WND

      >0       0     not acceptable

      >0      >0     RCV.NXT =< SEG.SEQ < RCV.NXT+RCV.WND
                  or RCV.NXT =< SEG.SEQ+SEG.LEN-1 < RCV.NXT+RCV.WND

  Note that when the receive window is zero no segments should be
  acceptable except ACK segments.  Thus, it is be possible for a TCP to
  maintain a zero receive window while transmitting data and receiving
  ACKs.  However, even when the receive window is zero, a TCP must
  process the RST and URG fields of all incoming segments.

  We have taken advantage of the numbering scheme to protect certain
  control information as well.  This is achieved by implicitly including
  some control flags in the sequence space so they can be retransmitted
  and acknowledged without confusion (i.e., one and only one copy of the
  control will be acted upon).  Control information is not physically
  carried in the segment data space.  Consequently, we must adopt rules
  for implicitly assigning sequence numbers to control.  The SYN and FIN
  are the only controls requiring this protection, and these controls
  are used only at connection opening and closing.  For sequence number
  purposes, the SYN is considered to occur before the first actual data
  octet of the segment in which it occurs, while the FIN is considered
  to occur after the last actual data octet in a segment in which it
  occurs.  The segment length (SEG.LEN) includes both data and sequence
  space occupying controls.  When a SYN is present then SEG.SEQ is the
  sequence number of the SYN.

  Initial Sequence Number Selection

  The protocol places no restriction on a particular connection being
  used over and over again.  A connection is defined by a pair of
  sockets.  New instances of a connection will be referred to as
  incarnations of the connection.  The problem that arises from this is
  -- "how does the TCP identify duplicate segments from previous
  incarnations of the connection?"  This problem becomes apparent if the
  connection is being opened and closed in quick succession, or if the
  connection breaks with loss of memory and is then reestablished.

  To avoid confusion we must prevent segments from one incarnation of a
  connection from being used while the same sequence numbers may still
  be present in the network from an earlier incarnation.  We want to
  assure this, even if a TCP crashes and loses all knowledge of the
  sequence numbers it has been using.  When new connections are created,
  an initial sequence number (ISN) generator is employed which selects a
  new 32 bit ISN.  The generator is bound to a (possibly fictitious) 32
  bit clock whose low order bit is incremented roughly every 4
  microseconds.  Thus, the ISN cycles approximately every 4.55 hours.
  Since we assume that segments will stay in the network no more than
  the Maximum Segment Lifetime (MSL) and that the MSL is less than 4.55
  hours we can reasonably assume that ISN's will be unique.

  For each connection there is a send sequence number and a receive
  sequence number.  The initial send sequence number (ISS) is chosen by
  the data sending TCP, and the initial receive sequence number (IRS) is
  learned during the connection establishing procedure.

  For a connection to be established or initialized, the two TCPs must
  synchronize on each other's initial sequence numbers.  This is done in
  an exchange of connection establishing segments carrying a control bit
  called "SYN" (for synchronize) and the initial sequence numbers.  As a
  shorthand, segments carrying the SYN bit are also called "SYNs".
  Hence, the solution requires a suitable mechanism for picking an
  initial sequence number and a slightly involved handshake to exchange
  the ISN's.

  The synchronization requires each side to send it's own initial
  sequence number and to receive a confirmation of it in acknowledgment
  from the other side.  Each side must also receive the other side's
  initial sequence number and send a confirming acknowledgment.

    1) A --> B  SYN my sequence number is X
    2) A <-- B  ACK your sequence number is X
    3) A <-- B  SYN my sequence number is Y
    4) A --> B  ACK your sequence number is Y



                                                               [Page 27]

Transmission Control Protocol
Functional Specification



  Because steps 2 and 3 can be combined in a single message this is
  called the three way (or three message) handshake.

  A three way handshake is necessary because sequence numbers are not
  tied to a global clock in the network, and TCPs may have different
  mechanisms for picking the ISN's.  The receiver of the first SYN has
  no way of knowing whether the segment was an old delayed one or not,
  unless it remembers the last sequence number used on the connection
  (which is not always possible), and so it must ask the sender to
  verify this SYN.  The three way handshake and the advantages of a
  clock-driven scheme are discussed in [3].

  Knowing When to Keep Quiet

  To be sure that a TCP does not create a segment that carries a
  sequence number which may be duplicated by an old segment remaining in
  the network, the TCP must keep quiet for a maximum segment lifetime
  (MSL) before assigning any sequence numbers upon starting up or
  recovering from a crash in which memory of sequence numbers in use was
  lost.  For this specification the MSL is taken to be 2 minutes.  This
  is an engineering choice, and may be changed if experience indicates
  it is desirable to do so.  Note that if a TCP is reinitialized in some
  sense, yet retains its memory of sequence numbers in use, then it need
  not wait at all; it must only be sure to use sequence numbers larger
  than those recently used.

  The TCP Quiet Time Concept

    This specification provides that hosts which "crash" without
    retaining any knowledge of the last sequence numbers transmitted on
    each active (i.e., not closed) connection shall delay emitting any
    TCP segments for at least the agreed Maximum Segment Lifetime (MSL)
    in the internet system of which the host is a part.  In the
    paragraphs below, an explanation for this specification is given.
    TCP implementors may violate the "quiet time" restriction, but only
    at the risk of causing some old data to be accepted as new or new
    data rejected as old duplicated by some receivers in the internet
    system.

    TCPs consume sequence number space each time a segment is formed and
    entered into the network output queue at a source host. The
    duplicate detection and sequencing algorithm in the TCP protocol
    relies on the unique binding of segment data to sequence space to
    the extent that sequence numbers will not cycle through all 2**32
    values before the segment data bound to those sequence numbers has
    been delivered and acknowledged by the receiver and all duplicate
    copies of the segments have "drained" from the internet.  Without
    such an assumption, two distinct TCP segments could conceivably be


[Page 28]

    assigned the same or overlapping sequence numbers, causing confusion
    at the receiver as to which data is new and which is old.  Remember
    that each segment is bound to as many consecutive sequence numbers
    as there are octets of data in the segment.

    Under normal conditions, TCPs keep track of the next sequence number
    to emit and the oldest awaiting acknowledgment so as to avoid
    mistakenly using a sequence number over before its first use has
    been acknowledged.  This alone does not guarantee that old duplicate
    data is drained from the net, so the sequence space has been made
    very large to reduce the probability that a wandering duplicate will
    cause trouble upon arrival.  At 2 megabits/sec. it takes 4.5 hours
    to use up 2**32 octets of sequence space.  Since the maximum segment
    lifetime in the net is not likely to exceed a few tens of seconds,
    this is deemed ample protection for foreseeable nets, even if data
    rates escalate to l0's of megabits/sec.  At 100 megabits/sec, the
    cycle time is 5.4 minutes which may be a little short, but still
    within reason.

    The basic duplicate detection and sequencing algorithm in TCP can be
    defeated, however, if a source TCP does not have any memory of the
    sequence numbers it last used on a given connection. For example, if
    the TCP were to start all connections with sequence number 0, then
    upon crashing and restarting, a TCP might re-form an earlier
    connection (possibly after half-open connection resolution) and emit
    packets with sequence numbers identical to or overlapping with
    packets still in the network which were emitted on an earlier
    incarnation of the same connection.  In the absence of knowledge
    about the sequence numbers used on a particular connection, the TCP
    specification recommends that the source delay for MSL seconds
    before emitting segments on the connection, to allow time for
    segments from the earlier connection incarnation to drain from the
    system.

    Even hosts which can remember the time of day and used it to select
    initial sequence number values are not immune from this problem
    (i.e., even if time of day is used to select an initial sequence
    number for each new connection incarnation).

    Suppose, for example, that a connection is opened starting with
    sequence number S.  Suppose that this connection is not used much
    and that eventually the initial sequence number function (ISN(t))
    takes on a value equal to the sequence number, say S1, of the last
    segment sent by this TCP on a particular connection.  Now suppose,
    at this instant, the host crashes, recovers, and establishes a new
    incarnation of the connection. The initial sequence number chosen is
    S1 = ISN(t) -- last used sequence number on old incarnation of
    connection!  If the recovery occurs quickly enough, any old


                                                               [Page 29]

Transmission Control Protocol
Functional Specification



    duplicates in the net bearing sequence numbers in the neighborhood
    of S1 may arrive and be treated as new packets by the receiver of
    the new incarnation of the connection.

    The problem is that the recovering host may not know for how long it
    crashed nor does it know whether there are still old duplicates in
    the system from earlier connection incarnations.

    One way to deal with this problem is to deliberately delay emitting
    segments for one MSL after recovery from a crash- this is the "quite
    time" specification.  Hosts which prefer to avoid waiting are
    willing to risk possible confusion of old and new packets at a given
    destination may choose not to wait for the "quite time".
    Implementors may provide TCP users with the ability to select on a
    connection by connection basis whether to wait after a crash, or may
    informally implement the "quite time" for all connections.
    Obviously, even where a user selects to "wait," this is not
    necessary after the host has been "up" for at least MSL seconds.

    To summarize: every segment emitted occupies one or more sequence
    numbers in the sequence space, the numbers occupied by a segment are
    "busy" or "in use" until MSL seconds have passed, upon crashing a
    block of space-time is occupied by the octets of the last emitted
    segment, if a new connection is started too soon and uses any of the
    sequence numbers in the space-time footprint of the last segment of
    the previous connection incarnation, there is a potential sequence
    number overlap area which could cause confusion at the receiver.

3.4.  Establishing a connection

  The "three-way handshake" is the procedure used to establish a
  connection.  This procedure normally is initiated by one TCP and
  responded to by another TCP.  The procedure also works if two TCP
  simultaneously initiate the procedure.  When simultaneous attempt
  occurs, each TCP receives a "SYN" segment which carries no
  acknowledgment after it has sent a "SYN".  Of course, the arrival of
  an old duplicate "SYN" segment can potentially make it appear, to the
  recipient, that a simultaneous connection initiation is in progress.
  Proper use of "reset" segments can disambiguate these cases.

  Several examples of connection initiation follow.  Although these
  examples do not show connection synchronization using data-carrying
  segments, this is perfectly legitimate, so long as the receiving TCP
  doesn't deliver the data to the user until it is clear the data is
  valid (i.e., the data must be buffered at the receiver until the
  connection reaches the ESTABLISHED state).  The three-way handshake
  reduces the possibility of false connections.  It is the

  The simplest three-way handshake is shown in figure 7 below.  The

  segment at B from A.  Left arrows (<--), indicate the reverse.
  Ellipsis (...) indicates a segment which is still in the network
  (delayed).  An "XXX" indicates a segment which is lost or rejected.
  Comments appear in parentheses.  TCP states represent the state AFTER
  the departure or arrival of the segment (whose contents are shown in
  the center of each line).  Segment contents are shown in abbreviated
  form, with sequence number, control flags, and ACK field.  Other
  fields such as window, addresses, lengths, and text have been left out
  in the interest of clarity.

  In line 2 of figure 7, TCP A begins by sending a SYN segment
  indicating that it will use sequence numbers starting with sequence
  number 100.  In line 3, TCP B sends a SYN and acknowledges the SYN it
  received from TCP A.  Note that the acknowledgment field indicates TCP
  B is now expecting to hear sequence 101, acknowledging the SYN which
  occupied sequence 100.

  At line 4, TCP A responds with an empty segment containing an ACK for
  TCP B's SYN; and in line 5, TCP A sends some data.  Note that the
  sequence number of the segment in line 5 is the same as in line 4
  because the ACK does not occupy sequence number space (if it did, we
  would wind up ACKing ACK's!).

  Simultaneous initiation is only slightly more complex, as is shown in

                               Figure 8.

  The principle reason for the three-way handshake is to prevent old
  duplicate connection initiations from causing confusion.  To deal with
  this, a special control message, reset, has been devised.  If the
  receiving TCP is in a  non-synchronized state (i.e., SYN-SENT,
  SYN-RECEIVED), it returns to LISTEN on receiving an acceptable reset.
  If the TCP is in one of the synchronized states (ESTABLISHED,
  FIN-WAIT-1, FIN-WAIT-2, CLOSE-WAIT, CLOSING, LAST-ACK, TIME-WAIT), it
  aborts the connection and informs its user.  We discuss this latter
  case under "half-open" connections below.

                               Figure 9.

  As a simple example of recovery from old duplicates, consider
  figure 9.  At line 3, an old duplicate SYN arrives at TCP B.  TCP B
  cannot tell that this is an old duplicate, so it responds normally
  (line 4).  TCP A detects that the ACK field is incorrect and returns a
  RST (reset) with its SEQ field selected to make the segment
  believable.  TCP B, on receiving the RST, returns to the LISTEN state.
  When the original SYN (pun intended) finally arrives at line 6, the
  synchronization proceeds normally.  If the SYN at line 6 had arrived
  before the RST, a more complex exchange might have occurred with RST's
  sent in both directions.

  Half-Open Connections and Other Anomalies

  An established connection is said to be  "half-open" if one of the
  TCPs has closed or aborted the connection at its end without the
  knowledge of the other, or if the two ends of the connection have
  become desynchronized owing to a crash that resulted in loss of
  memory.  Such connections will automatically become reset if an
  attempt is made to send data in either direction.  However, half-open
  connections are expected to be unusual, and the recovery procedure is
  mildly involved.

  If at site A the connection no longer exists, then an attempt by the

  user at site B to send any data on it will result in the site B TCP
  receiving a reset control message.  Such a message indicates to the
  site B TCP that something is wrong, and it is expected to abort the
  connection.

  Assume that two user processes A and B are communicating with one
  another when a crash occurs causing loss of memory to A's TCP.
  Depending on the operating system supporting A's TCP, it is likely
  that some error recovery mechanism exists.  When the TCP is up again,
  A is likely to start again from the beginning or from a recovery
  point.  As a result, A will probably try to OPEN the connection again
  or try to SEND on the connection it believes open.  In the latter
  case, it receives the error message "connection not open" from the
  local (A's) TCP.  In an attempt to establish the connection, A's TCP
  will send a segment containing SYN.  This scenario leads to the
  example shown in figure 10.  After TCP A crashes, the user attempts to
  re-open the connection.  TCP B, in the meantime, thinks the connection
  is open.



      TCP A                                           TCP B

  When the SYN arrives at line 3, TCP B, being in a synchronized state,
  and the incoming segment outside the window, responds with an
  acknowledgment indicating what sequence it next expects to hear (ACK
  100).  TCP A sees that this segment does not acknowledge anything it
  sent and, being unsynchronized, sends a reset (RST) because it has
  detected a half-open connection.  TCP B aborts at line 5.  TCP A will

  continue to try to establish the connection; the problem is now
  reduced to the basic 3-way handshake of figure 7.

  An interesting alternative case occurs when TCP A crashes and TCP B
  tries to send data on what it thinks is a synchronized connection.
  This is illustrated in figure 11.  In this case, the data arriving at
  TCP A from TCP B (line 2) is unacceptable because no such connection
  exists, so TCP A sends a RST.  The RST is acceptable so TCP B
  processes it and aborts the connection.

  generate a RST (the ACK in line 3 is not acceptable).  TCP B accepts
  the reset and returns to its passive LISTEN state.

  A variety of other cases are possible, all of which are accounted for
  by the following rules for RST generation and processing.

  Reset Generation

  As a general rule, reset (RST) must be sent whenever a segment arrives
  which apparently is not intended for the current connection.  A reset
  must not be sent if it is not clear that this is the case.

  There are three groups of states:

    1.  If the connection does not exist (CLOSED) then a reset is sent
    in response to any incoming segment except another reset.  In
    particular, SYNs addressed to a non-existent connection are rejected
    by this means.

    If the incoming segment has an ACK field, the reset takes its
    sequence number from the ACK field of the segment, otherwise the
    reset has sequence number zero and the ACK field is set to the sum
    of the sequence number and segment length of the incoming segment.
    The connection remains in the CLOSED state.

    2.  If the connection is in any non-synchronized state (LISTEN,
    SYN-SENT, SYN-RECEIVED), and the incoming segment acknowledges
    something not yet sent (the segment carries an unacceptable ACK), or
    if an incoming segment has a security level or compartment which
    does not exactly match the level and compartment requested for the
    connection, a reset is sent.

    If our SYN has not been acknowledged and the precedence level of the
    incoming segment is higher than the precedence level requested then
    either raise the local precedence level (if allowed by the user and
    the system) or send a reset; or if the precedence level of the
    incoming segment is lower than the precedence level requested then
    continue as if the precedence matched exactly (if the remote TCP
    cannot raise the precedence level to match ours this will be
    detected in the next segment it sends, and the connection will be
    terminated then).  If our SYN has been acknowledged (perhaps in this
    incoming segment) the precedence level of the incoming segment must
    match the local precedence level exactly, if it does not a reset
    must be sent.

    If the incoming segment has an ACK field, the reset takes its
    sequence number from the ACK field of the segment, otherwise the
    reset has sequence number zero and the ACK field is set to the sum
    of the sequence number and segment length of the incoming segment.
    The connection remains in the same state.

                                                Functional Specification



    3.  If the connection is in a synchronized state (ESTABLISHED,
    FIN-WAIT-1, FIN-WAIT-2, CLOSE-WAIT, CLOSING, LAST-ACK, TIME-WAIT),
    any unacceptable segment (out of window sequence number or
    unacceptible acknowledgment number) must elicit only an empty
    acknowledgment segment containing the current send-sequence number
    and an acknowledgment indicating the next sequence number expected
    to be received, and the connection remains in the same state.

    If an incoming segment has a security level, or compartment, or
    precedence which does not exactly match the level, and compartment,
    and precedence requested for the connection,a reset is sent and
    connection goes to the CLOSED state.  The reset takes its sequence
    number from the ACK field of the incoming segment.

  Reset Processing

  In all states except SYN-SENT, all reset (RST) segments are validated
  by checking their SEQ-fields.  A reset is valid if its sequence number
  is in the window.  In the SYN-SENT state (a RST received in response
  to an initial SYN), the RST is acceptable if the ACK field
  acknowledges the SYN.

  The receiver of a RST first validates it, then changes state.  If the
  receiver was in the LISTEN state, it ignores it.  If the receiver was
  in SYN-RECEIVED state and had previously been in the LISTEN state,
  then the receiver returns to the LISTEN state, otherwise the receiver
  aborts the connection and goes to the CLOSED state.  If the receiver
  was in any other state, it aborts the connection and advises the user
  and goes to the CLOSED state.

3.5.  Closing a Connection

  CLOSE is an operation meaning "I have no more data to send."  The
  notion of closing a full-duplex connection is subject to ambiguous
  interpretation, of course, since it may not be obvious how to treat
  the receiving side of the connection.  We have chosen to treat CLOSE
  in a simplex fashion.  The user who CLOSEs may continue to RECEIVE
  until he is told that the other side has CLOSED also.  Thus, a program
  could initiate several SENDs followed by a CLOSE, and then continue to
  RECEIVE until signaled that a RECEIVE failed because the other side
  has CLOSED.  We assume that the TCP will signal a user, even if no
  RECEIVEs are outstanding, that the other side has closed, so the user
  can terminate his side gracefully.  A TCP will reliably deliver all
  buffers SENT before the connection was CLOSED so a user who expects no
  data in return need only wait to hear the connection was CLOSED
  successfully to know that all his data was received at the destination
  TCP.  Users must keep reading connections they close for sending until
  the TCP says no more data.


                                                               [Page 37]

Transmission Control Protocol
Functional Specification



  There are essentially three cases:

    1) The user initiates by telling the TCP to CLOSE the connection

    2) The remote TCP initiates by sending a FIN control signal

    3) Both users CLOSE simultaneously

  Case 1:  Local user initiates the close

    In this case, a FIN segment can be constructed and placed on the
    outgoing segment queue.  No further SENDs from the user will be
    accepted by the TCP, and it enters the FIN-WAIT-1 state.  RECEIVEs
    are allowed in this state.  All segments preceding and including FIN
    will be retransmitted until acknowledged.  When the other TCP has
    both acknowledged the FIN and sent a FIN of its own, the first TCP
    can ACK this FIN.  Note that a TCP receiving a FIN will ACK but not
    send its own FIN until its user has CLOSED the connection also.

  Case 2:  TCP receives a FIN from the network

    If an unsolicited FIN arrives from the network, the receiving TCP
    can ACK it and tell the user that the connection is closing.  The
    user will respond with a CLOSE, upon which the TCP can send a FIN to
    the other TCP after sending any remaining data.  The TCP then waits
    until its own FIN is acknowledged whereupon it deletes the
    connection.  If an ACK is not forthcoming, after the user timeout
    the connection is aborted and the user is told.

  Case 3:  both users close simultaneously

    A simultaneous CLOSE by users at both ends of a connection causes
    FIN segments to be exchanged.  When all segments preceding the FINs
    have been processed and acknowledged, each TCP can ACK the FIN it
    has received.  Both will, upon receiving these ACKs, delete the
    connection.

3.6.  Precedence and Security

  The intent is that connection be allowed only between ports operating
  with exactly the same security and compartment values and at the
  higher of the precedence level requested by the two ports.

  The precedence and security parameters used in TCP are exactly those
  defined in the Internet Protocol (IP) [2].  Throughout this TCP
  specification the term "security/compartment" is intended to indicate
  the security parameters used in IP including security, compartment,
  user group, and handling restriction.

  A connection attempt with mismatched security/compartment values or a
  lower precedence value must be rejected by sending a reset.  Rejecting
  a connection due to too low a precedence only occurs after an
  acknowledgment of the SYN has been received.

  Note that TCP modules which operate only at the default value of
  precedence will still have to check the precedence of incoming
  segments and possibly raise the precedence level they use on the
  connection.

  The security paramaters may be used even in a non-secure environment
  (the values would indicate unclassified data), thus hosts in
  non-secure environments must be prepared to receive the security
  parameters, though they need not send them.

3.7.  Data Communication

  Once the connection is established data is communicated by the
  exchange of segments.  Because segments may be lost due to errors
  (checksum test failure), or network congestion, TCP uses
  retransmission (after a timeout) to ensure delivery of every segment.
  Duplicate segments may arrive due to network or TCP retransmission.
  As discussed in the section on sequence numbers the TCP performs
  certain tests on the sequence and acknowledgment numbers in the
  segments to verify their acceptability.

  The sender of data keeps track of the next sequence number to use in
  the variable SND.NXT.  The receiver of data keeps track of the next
  sequence number to expect in the variable RCV.NXT.  The sender of data
  keeps track of the oldest unacknowledged sequence number in the
  variable SND.UNA.  If the data flow is momentarily idle and all data
  sent has been acknowledged then the three variables will be equal.

  When the sender creates a segment and transmits it the sender advances
  SND.NXT.  When the receiver accepts a segment it advances RCV.NXT and
  sends an acknowledgment.  When the data sender receives an

                                                Functional Specification



  acknowledgment it advances SND.UNA.  The extent to which the values of
  these variables differ is a measure of the delay in the communication.
  The amount by which the variables are advanced is the length of the
  data in the segment.  Note that once in the ESTABLISHED state all
  segments must carry current acknowledgment information.

  The CLOSE user call implies a push function, as does the FIN control
  flag in an incoming segment.

  Retransmission Timeout

  Because of the variability of the networks that compose an
  internetwork system and the wide range of uses of TCP connections the
  retransmission timeout must be dynamically determined.  One procedure
  for determining a retransmission time out is given here as an
  illustration.

    An Example Retransmission Timeout Procedure

      Measure the elapsed time between sending a data octet with a
      particular sequence number and receiving an acknowledgment that
      covers that sequence number (segments sent do not have to match
      segments received).  This measured elapsed time is the Round Trip
      Time (RTT).  Next compute a Smoothed Round Trip Time (SRTT) as:

        SRTT = ( ALPHA * SRTT ) + ((1-ALPHA) * RTT)

      and based on this, compute the retransmission timeout (RTO) as:

        RTO = min[UBOUND,max[LBOUND,(BETA*SRTT)]]

      where UBOUND is an upper bound on the timeout (e.g., 1 minute),
      LBOUND is a lower bound on the timeout (e.g., 1 second), ALPHA is
      a smoothing factor (e.g., .8 to .9), and BETA is a delay variance
      factor (e.g., 1.3 to 2.0).

  The Communication of Urgent Information

  The objective of the TCP urgent mechanism is to allow the sending user
  to stimulate the receiving user to accept some urgent data and to
  permit the receiving TCP to indicate to the receiving user when all
  the currently known urgent data has been received by the user.

  This mechanism permits a point in the data stream to be designated as
  the end of urgent information.  Whenever this point is in advance of
  the receive sequence number (RCV.NXT) at the receiving TCP, that TCP
  must tell the user to go into "urgent mode"; when the receive sequence
  number catches up to the urgent pointer, the TCP must tell user to go


                                                               [Page 41]

                                                          September 1981
Transmission Control Protocol
Functional Specification



  into "normal mode".  If the urgent pointer is updated while the user
  is in "urgent mode", the update will be invisible to the user.

  The method employs a urgent field which is carried in all segments
  transmitted.  The URG control flag indicates that the urgent field is
  meaningful and must be added to the segment sequence number to yield
  the urgent pointer.  The absence of this flag indicates that there is
  no urgent data outstanding.

  To send an urgent indication the user must also send at least one data
  octet.  If the sending user also indicates a push, timely delivery of
  the urgent information to the destination process is enhanced.

  Managing the Window

  The window sent in each segment indicates the range of sequence
  numbers the sender of the window (the data receiver) is currently
  prepared to accept.  There is an assumption that this is related to
  the currently available data buffer space available for this
  connection.

  Indicating a large window encourages transmissions.  If more data
  arrives than can be accepted, it will be discarded.  This will result
  in excessive retransmissions, adding unnecessarily to the load on the
  network and the TCPs.  Indicating a small window may restrict the
  transmission of data to the point of introducing a round trip delay
  between each new segment transmitted.

  The mechanisms provided allow a TCP to advertise a large window and to
  subsequently advertise a much smaller window without having accepted
  that much data.  This, so called "shrinking the window," is strongly
  discouraged.  The robustness principle dictates that TCPs will not
  shrink the window themselves, but will be prepared for such behavior
  on the part of other TCPs.

  The sending TCP must be prepared to accept from the user and send at
  least one octet of new data even if the send window is zero.  The
  sending TCP must regularly retransmit to the receiving TCP even when
  the window is zero.  Two minutes is recommended for the retransmission
  interval when the window is zero.  This retransmission is essential to
  guarantee that when either TCP has a zero window the re-opening of the
  window will be reliably reported to the other.

  When the receiving TCP has a zero window and a segment arrives it must
  still send an acknowledgment showing its next expected sequence number
  and current window (zero).

  The sending TCP packages the data to be transmitted into segments

  which fit the current window, and may repackage segments on the
  retransmission queue.  Such repackaging is not required, but may be
  helpful.

  In a connection with a one-way data flow, the window information will
  be carried in acknowledgment segments that all have the same sequence
  number so there will be no way to reorder them if they arrive out of
  order.  This is not a serious problem, but it will allow the window
  information to be on occasion temporarily based on old reports from
  the data receiver.  A refinement to avoid this problem is to act on
  the window information from segments that carry the highest
  acknowledgment number (that is segments with acknowledgment number
  equal or greater than the highest previously received).

  The window management procedure has significant influence on the
  communication performance.  The following comments are suggestions to
  implementers.

    Window Management Suggestions

      Allocating a very small window causes data to be transmitted in
      many small segments when better performance is achieved using
      fewer large segments.

      One suggestion for avoiding small windows is for the receiver to
      defer updating a window until the additional allocation is at
      least X percent of the maximum allocation possible for the
      connection (where X might be 20 to 40).

      Another suggestion is for the sender to avoid sending small
      segments by waiting until the window is large enough before
      sending data.  If the the user signals a push function then the
      data must be sent even if it is a small segment.

      Note that the acknowledgments should not be delayed or unnecessary
      retransmissions will result.  One strategy would be to send an
      acknowledgment when a small segment arrives (with out updating the
      window information), and then to send another acknowledgment with
      new window information when the window is larger.

      The segment sent to probe a zero window may also begin a break up
      of transmitted data into smaller and smaller segments.  If a
      segment containing a single data octet sent to probe a zero window
      is accepted, it consumes one octet of the window now available.
      If the sending TCP simply sends as much as it can whenever the
      window is non zero, the transmitted data will be broken into
      alternating big and small segments.  As time goes on, occasional
      pauses in the receiver making window allocation available will


                                                               [Page 43]

      result in breaking the big segments into a small and not quite so
      big pair. And after a while the data transmission will be in
      mostly small segments.

      The suggestion here is that the TCP implementations need to
      actively attempt to combine small window allocations into larger
      windows, since the mechanisms for managing the window tend to lead
      to many small windows in the simplest minded implementations.

3.8.  Interfaces

  There are of course two interfaces of concern:  the user/TCP interface
  and the TCP/lower-level interface.  We have a fairly elaborate model
  of the user/TCP interface, but the interface to the lower level
  protocol module is left unspecified here, since it will be specified
  in detail by the specification of the lowel level protocol.  For the
  case that the lower level is IP we note some of the parameter values
  that TCPs might use.

  User/TCP Interface

    The following functional description of user commands to the TCP is,
    at best, fictional, since every operating system will have different
    facilities.  Consequently, we must warn readers that different TCP
    implementations may have different user interfaces.  However, all
    TCPs must provide a certain minimum set of services to guarantee
    that all TCP implementations can support the same protocol
    hierarchy.  This section specifies the functional interfaces
    required of all TCP implementations.

    TCP User Commands

      The following sections functionally characterize a USER/TCP
      interface.  The notation used is similar to most procedure or
      function calls in high level languages, but this usage is not
      meant to rule out trap type service calls (e.g., SVCs, UUOs,
      EMTs).

      The user commands described below specify the basic functions the
      TCP must perform to support interprocess communication.
      Individual implementations must define their own exact format, and
      may provide combinations or subsets of the basic functions in
      single calls.  In particular, some implementations may wish to
      automatically OPEN a connection on the first SEND or RECEIVE
      issued by the user for a given connection.

      In providing interprocess communication facilities, the TCP must
      not only accept commands, but must also return information to the
      processes it serves.  The latter consists of:

        (a) general information about a connection (e.g., interrupts,
        remote close, binding of unspecified foreign socket).

        (b) replies to specific user commands indicating success or
        various types of failure.

      Open

        Format:  OPEN (local port, foreign socket, active/passive
        [, timeout] [, precedence] [, security/compartment] [, options])
        -> local connection name

        We assume that the local TCP is aware of the identity of the
        processes it serves and will check the authority of the process
        to use the connection specified.  Depending upon the
        implementation of the TCP, the local network and TCP identifiers
        for the source address will either be supplied by the TCP or the
        lower level protocol (e.g., IP).  These considerations are the
        result of concern about security, to the extent that no TCP be
        able to masquerade as another one, and so on.  Similarly, no
        process can masquerade as another without the collusion of the
        TCP.

        If the active/passive flag is set to passive, then this is a
        call to LISTEN for an incoming connection.  A passive open may
        have either a fully specified foreign socket to wait for a
        particular connection or an unspecified foreign socket to wait
        for any call.  A fully specified passive call can be made active
        by the subsequent execution of a SEND.

        A transmission control block (TCB) is created and partially
        filled in with data from the OPEN command parameters.

        On an active OPEN command, the TCP will begin the procedure to
        synchronize (i.e., establish) the connection at once.

        The timeout, if present, permits the caller to set up a timeout
        for all data submitted to TCP.  If data is not successfully
        delivered to the destination within the timeout period, the TCP
        will abort the connection.  The present global default is five
        minutes.

        The TCP or some component of the operating system will verify
        the users authority to open a connection with the specified


                                                               [Page 45]

Functional Specification



        precedence or security/compartment.  The absence of precedence
        or security/compartment specification in the OPEN call indicates
        the default values must be used.

        TCP will accept incoming requests as matching only if the
        security/compartment information is exactly the same and only if
        the precedence is equal to or higher than the precedence
        requested in the OPEN call.

        The precedence for the connection is the higher of the values
        requested in the OPEN call and received from the incoming
        request, and fixed at that value for the life of the
        connection.Implementers may want to give the user control of
        this precedence negotiation.  For example, the user might be
        allowed to specify that the precedence must be exactly matched,
        or that any attempt to raise the precedence be confirmed by the
        user.

        A local connection name will be returned to the user by the TCP.
        The local connection name can then be used as a short hand term
        for the connection defined by the <local socket, foreign socket>
        pair.

      Send

        Format:  SEND (local connection name, buffer address, byte
        count, PUSH flag, URGENT flag [,timeout])

        This call causes the data contained in the indicated user buffer
        to be sent on the indicated connection.  If the connection has
        not been opened, the SEND is considered an error.  Some
        implementations may allow users to SEND first; in which case, an
        automatic OPEN would be done.  If the calling process is not
        authorized to use this connection, an error is returned.

        If the PUSH flag is set, the data must be transmitted promptly
        to the receiver, and the PUSH bit will be set in the last TCP
        segment created from the buffer.  If the PUSH flag is not set,
        the data may be combined with data from subsequent SENDs for
        transmission efficiency.

        If the URGENT flag is set, segments sent to the destination TCP
        will have the urgent pointer set.  The receiving TCP will signal
        the urgent condition to the receiving process if the urgent
        pointer indicates that data preceding the urgent pointer has not
        been consumed by the receiving process.  The purpose of urgent
        is to stimulate the receiver to process the urgent data and to
        indicate to the receiver when all the currently known urgent


[Page 46]

September 1981
                                           Transmission Control Protocol
                                                Functional Specification



        data has been received.  The number of times the sending user's
        TCP signals urgent will not necessarily be equal to the number
        of times the receiving user will be notified of the presence of
        urgent data.

        If no foreign socket was specified in the OPEN, but the
        connection is established (e.g., because a LISTENing connection
        has become specific due to a foreign segment arriving for the
        local socket), then the designated buffer is sent to the implied
        foreign socket.  Users who make use of OPEN with an unspecified
        foreign socket can make use of SEND without ever explicitly
        knowing the foreign socket address.

        However, if a SEND is attempted before the foreign socket
        becomes specified, an error will be returned.  Users can use the
        STATUS call to determine the status of the connection.  In some
        implementations the TCP may notify the user when an unspecified
        socket is bound.

        If a timeout is specified, the current user timeout for this
        connection is changed to the new one.

        In the simplest implementation, SEND would not return control to
        the sending process until either the transmission was complete
        or the timeout had been exceeded.  However, this simple method
        is both subject to deadlocks (for example, both sides of the
        connection might try to do SENDs before doing any RECEIVEs) and
        offers poor performance, so it is not recommended.  A more
        sophisticated implementation would return immediately to allow
        the process to run concurrently with network I/O, and,
        furthermore, to allow multiple SENDs to be in progress.
        Multiple SENDs are served in first come, first served order, so
        the TCP will queue those it cannot service immediately.

        We have implicitly assumed an asynchronous user interface in
        which a SEND later elicits some kind of SIGNAL or
        pseudo-interrupt from the serving TCP.  An alternative is to
        return a response immediately.  For instance, SENDs might return
        immediate local acknowledgment, even if the segment sent had not
        been acknowledged by the distant TCP.  We could optimistically
        assume eventual success.  If we are wrong, the connection will
        close anyway due to the timeout.  In implementations of this
        kind (synchronous), there will still be some asynchronous
        signals, but these will deal with the connection itself, and not
        with specific segments or buffers.

        In order for the process to distinguish among error or success
        indications for different SENDs, it might be appropriate for the


                                                               [Page 47]

        buffer address to be returned along with the coded response to
        the SEND request.  TCP-to-user signals are discussed below,
        indicating the information which should be returned to the
        calling process.

      Receive

        Format:  RECEIVE (local connection name, buffer address, byte
        count) -> byte count, urgent flag, push flag

        This command allocates a receiving buffer associated with the
        specified connection.  If no OPEN precedes this command or the
        calling process is not authorized to use this connection, an
        error is returned.

        In the simplest implementation, control would not return to the
        calling program until either the buffer was filled, or some
        error occurred, but this scheme is highly subject to deadlocks.
        A more sophisticated implementation would permit several
        RECEIVEs to be outstanding at once.  These would be filled as
        segments arrive.  This strategy permits increased throughput at
        the cost of a more elaborate scheme (possibly asynchronous) to
        notify the calling program that a PUSH has been seen or a buffer
        filled.

        If enough data arrive to fill the buffer before a PUSH is seen,
        the PUSH flag will not be set in the response to the RECEIVE.
        The buffer will be filled with as much data as it can hold.  If
        a PUSH is seen before the buffer is filled the buffer will be
        returned partially filled and PUSH indicated.

        If there is urgent data the user will have been informed as soon
        as it arrived via a TCP-to-user signal.  The receiving user
        should thus be in "urgent mode".  If the URGENT flag is on,
        additional urgent data remains.  If the URGENT flag is off, this
        call to RECEIVE has returned all the urgent data, and the user
        may now leave "urgent mode".  Note that data following the
        urgent pointer (non-urgent data) cannot be delivered to the user
        in the same buffer with preceeding urgent data unless the
        boundary is clearly marked for the user.

        To distinguish among several outstanding RECEIVEs and to take
        care of the case that a buffer is not completely filled, the
        return code is accompanied by both a buffer pointer and a byte
        count indicating the actual length of the data received.

        Alternative implementations of RECEIVE might have the TCP

        allocate buffer storage, or the TCP might share a ring buffer
        with the user.

      Close

        Format:  CLOSE (local connection name)

        This command causes the connection specified to be closed.  If
        the connection is not open or the calling process is not
        authorized to use this connection, an error is returned.
        Closing connections is intended to be a graceful operation in
        the sense that outstanding SENDs will be transmitted (and
        retransmitted), as flow control permits, until all have been
        serviced.  Thus, it should be acceptable to make several SEND
        calls, followed by a CLOSE, and expect all the data to be sent
        to the destination.  It should also be clear that users should
        continue to RECEIVE on CLOSING connections, since the other side
        may be trying to transmit the last of its data.  Thus, CLOSE
        means "I have no more to send" but does not mean "I will not
        receive any more."  It may happen (if the user level protocol is
        not well thought out) that the closing side is unable to get rid
        of all its data before timing out.  In this event, CLOSE turns
        into ABORT, and the closing TCP gives up.

        The user may CLOSE the connection at any time on his own
        initiative, or in response to various prompts from the TCP
        (e.g., remote close executed, transmission timeout exceeded,
        destination inaccessible).

        Because closing a connection requires communication with the
        foreign TCP, connections may remain in the closing state for a
        short time.  Attempts to reopen the connection before the TCP
        replies to the CLOSE command will result in error responses.

        Close also implies push function.

      Status

        Format:  STATUS (local connection name) -> status data

        This is an implementation dependent user command and could be
        excluded without adverse effect.  Information returned would
        typically come from the TCB associated with the connection.

        This command returns a data block containing the following
        information:

          local socket,


                                                               [Page 49]

Transmission Control Protocol
Functional Specification



          foreign socket,
          local connection name,
          receive window,
          send window,
          connection state,
          number of buffers awaiting acknowledgment,
          number of buffers pending receipt,
          urgent state,
          precedence,
          security/compartment,
          and transmission timeout.

        Depending on the state of the connection, or on the
        implementation itself, some of this information may not be
        available or meaningful.  If the calling process is not
        authorized to use this connection, an error is returned.  This
        prevents unauthorized processes from gaining information about a
        connection.

      Abort

        Format:  ABORT (local connection name)

        This command causes all pending SENDs and RECEIVES to be
        aborted, the TCB to be removed, and a special RESET message to
        be sent to the TCP on the other side of the connection.
        Depending on the implementation, users may receive abort
        indications for each outstanding SEND or RECEIVE, or may simply
        receive an ABORT-acknowledgment.

    TCP-to-User Messages

      It is assumed that the operating system environment provides a
      means for the TCP to asynchronously signal the user program.  When
      the TCP does signal a user program, certain information is passed
      to the user.  Often in the specification the information will be
      an error message.  In other cases there will be information
      relating to the completion of processing a SEND or RECEIVE or
      other user call.

      The following information is provided:

        Local Connection Name                    Always
        Response String                          Always
        Buffer Address                           Send & Receive
        Byte count (counts bytes received)       Receive
        Push flag                                Receive
        Urgent flag                              Receive

  TCP/Lower-Level Interface

    The TCP calls on a lower level protocol module to actually send and
    receive information over a network.  One case is that of the ARPA
    internetwork system where the lower level module is the Internet
    Protocol (IP) [2].

    If the lower level protocol is IP it provides arguments for a type
    of service and for a time to live.  TCP uses the following settings
    for these parameters:

      Type of Service = Precedence: routine, Delay: normal, Throughput:
      normal, Reliability: normal; or 00000000.

      Time to Live    = one minute, or 00111100.

        Note that the assumed maximum segment lifetime is two minutes.
        Here we explicitly ask that a segment be destroyed if it cannot
        be delivered by the internet system within one minute.

    If the lower level is IP (or other protocol that provides this
    feature) and source routing is used, the interface must allow the
    route information to be communicated.  This is especially important
    so that the source and destination addresses used in the TCP
    checksum be the originating source and ultimate destination. It is
    also important to preserve the return route to answer connection
    requests.

    Any lower level protocol will have to provide the source address,
    destination address, and protocol fields, and some way to determine
    the "TCP length", both to provide the functional equivlent service
    of IP and to be used in the TCP checksum.

3.9.  Event Processing

  The processing depicted in this section is an example of one possible
  implementation.  Other implementations may have slightly different
  processing sequences, but they should differ from those in this
  section only in detail, not in substance.

  The activity of the TCP can be characterized as responding to events.
  The events that occur can be cast into three categories:  user calls,
  arriving segments, and timeouts.  This section describes the
  processing the TCP does in response to each of the events.  In many
  cases the processing required depends on the state of the connection.

    Events that occur:

      User Calls

        OPEN
        SEND
        RECEIVE
        CLOSE
        ABORT
        STATUS

      Arriving Segments

        SEGMENT ARRIVES

      Timeouts

        USER TIMEOUT
        RETRANSMISSION TIMEOUT
        TIME-WAIT TIMEOUT

  The model of the TCP/user interface is that user commands receive an
  immediate return and possibly a delayed response via an event or
  pseudo interrupt.  In the following descriptions, the term "signal"
  means cause a delayed response.

  Error responses are given as character strings.  For example, user
  commands referencing connections that do not exist receive "error:
  connection not open".

  Please note in the following that all arithmetic on sequence numbers,
  acknowledgment numbers, windows, et cetera, is modulo 2**32 the size
  of the sequence number space.  Also note that "=<" means less than or
  equal to (modulo 2**32).

  A natural way to think about processing incoming segments is to
  imagine that they are first tested for proper sequence number (i.e.,
  that their contents lie in the range of the expected "receive window"
  in the sequence number space) and then that they are generally queued
  and processed in sequence number order.

  When a segment overlaps other already received segments we reconstruct
  the segment to contain just the new data, and adjust the header fields
  to be consistent.

  Note that if no state change is mentioned the TCP stays in the same
  state.

  OPEN Call

    CLOSED STATE (i.e., TCB does not exist)

      Create a new transmission control block (TCB) to hold connection
      state information.  Fill in local socket identifier, foreign
      socket, precedence, security/compartment, and user timeout
      information.  Note that some parts of the foreign socket may be
      unspecified in a passive OPEN and are to be filled in by the
      parameters of the incoming SYN segment.  Verify the security and
      precedence requested are allowed for this user, if not return
      "error:  precedence not allowed" or "error:  security/compartment
      not allowed."  If passive enter the LISTEN state and return.  If
      active and the foreign socket is unspecified, return "error:
      foreign socket unspecified"; if active and the foreign socket is
      specified, issue a SYN segment.  An initial send sequence number
      (ISS) is selected.  A SYN segment of the form <SEQ=ISS><CTL=SYN>
      is sent.  Set SND.UNA to ISS, SND.NXT to ISS+1, enter SYN-SENT
      state, and return.

      If the caller does not have access to the local socket specified,
      return "error:  connection illegal for this process".  If there is
      no room to create a new connection, return "error:  insufficient
      resources".

    LISTEN STATE

      If active and the foreign socket is specified, then change the
      connection from passive to active, select an ISS.  Send a SYN
      segment, set SND.UNA to ISS, SND.NXT to ISS+1.  Enter SYN-SENT
      state.  Data associated with SEND may be sent with SYN segment or

SEGMENT ARRIVES



  SEGMENT ARRIVES

    If the state is CLOSED (i.e., TCB does not exist) then

      all data in the incoming segment is discarded.  An incoming
      segment containing a RST is discarded.  An incoming segment not
      containing a RST causes a RST to be sent in response.  The
      acknowledgment and sequence field values are selected to make the
      reset sequence acceptable to the TCP that sent the offending
      segment.

      If the ACK bit is off, sequence number zero is used,

        <SEQ=0><ACK=SEG.SEQ+SEG.LEN><CTL=RST,ACK>

      If the ACK bit is on,

        <SEQ=SEG.ACK><CTL=RST>

      Return.

    If the state is LISTEN then

      first check for an RST

        An incoming RST should be ignored.  Return.

      second check for an ACK

        Any acknowledgment is bad if it arrives on a connection still in
        the LISTEN state.  An acceptable reset segment should be formed
        for any arriving ACK-bearing segment.  The RST should be
        formatted as follows:

          <SEQ=SEG.ACK><CTL=RST>

        Return.

      third check for a SYN

        If the SYN bit is set, check the security.  If the
        security/compartment on the incoming segment does not exactly
        match the security/compartment in the TCB then send a reset and
        return.

          <SEQ=SEG.ACK><CTL=RST>



                                                               [Page 65]

                                                         SEGMENT ARRIVES



        If the SEG.PRC is greater than the TCB.PRC then if allowed by
        the user and the system set TCB.PRC<-SEG.PRC, if not allowed
        send a reset and return.

          <SEQ=SEG.ACK><CTL=RST>

        If the SEG.PRC is less than the TCB.PRC then continue.

        Set RCV.NXT to SEG.SEQ+1, IRS is set to SEG.SEQ and any other
        control or text should be queued for processing later.  ISS
        should be selected and a SYN segment sent of the form:

          <SEQ=ISS><ACK=RCV.NXT><CTL=SYN,ACK>

        SND.NXT is set to ISS+1 and SND.UNA to ISS.  The connection
        state should be changed to SYN-RECEIVED.  Note that any other
        incoming control or data (combined with SYN) will be processed
        in the SYN-RECEIVED state, but processing of SYN and ACK should
        not be repeated.  If the listen was not fully specified (i.e.,
        the foreign socket was not fully specified), then the
        unspecified fields should be filled in now.

      fourth other text or control

        Any other control or text-bearing segment (not containing SYN)
        must have an ACK and thus would be discarded by the ACK
        processing.  An incoming RST segment could not be valid, since
        it could not have been sent in response to anything sent by this
        incarnation of the connection.  So you are unlikely to get here,
        but if you do, drop the segment, and return.

    If the state is SYN-SENT then

      first check the ACK bit

        If the ACK bit is set

          If SEG.ACK =< ISS, or SEG.ACK > SND.NXT, send a reset (unless
          the RST bit is set, if so drop the segment and return)

            <SEQ=SEG.ACK><CTL=RST>

          and discard the segment.  Return.

          If SND.UNA =< SEG.ACK =< SND.NXT then the ACK is acceptable.

      second check the RST bit

SEGMENT ARRIVES



        If the RST bit is set

          If the ACK was acceptable then signal the user "error:
          connection reset", drop the segment, enter CLOSED state,
          delete TCB, and return.  Otherwise (no ACK) drop the segment
          and return.

      third check the security and precedence

        If the security/compartment in the segment does not exactly
        match the security/compartment in the TCB, send a reset

          If there is an ACK

            <SEQ=SEG.ACK><CTL=RST>

          Otherwise

            <SEQ=0><ACK=SEG.SEQ+SEG.LEN><CTL=RST,ACK>

        If there is an ACK

          The precedence in the segment must match the precedence in the
          TCB, if not, send a reset

            <SEQ=SEG.ACK><CTL=RST>

        If there is no ACK

          If the precedence in the segment is higher than the precedence
          in the TCB then if allowed by the user and the system raise
          the precedence in the TCB to that in the segment, if not
          allowed to raise the prec then send a reset.

            <SEQ=0><ACK=SEG.SEQ+SEG.LEN><CTL=RST,ACK>

          If the precedence in the segment is lower than the precedence
          in the TCB continue.

        If a reset was sent, discard the segment and return.

      fourth check the SYN bit

        This step should be reached only if the ACK is ok, or there is
        no ACK, and it the segment did not contain a RST.

        If the SYN bit is on and the security/compartment and precedence

        are acceptable then, RCV.NXT is set to SEG.SEQ+1, IRS is set to
        SEG.SEQ.  SND.UNA should be advanced to equal SEG.ACK (if there
        is an ACK), and any segments on the retransmission queue which
        are thereby acknowledged should be removed.

        If SND.UNA > ISS (our SYN has been ACKed), change the connection
        state to ESTABLISHED, form an ACK segment

          <SEQ=SND.NXT><ACK=RCV.NXT><CTL=ACK>

        and send it.  Data or controls which were queued for
        transmission may be included.  If there are other controls or
        text in the segment then continue processing at the sixth step
        below where the URG bit is checked, otherwise return.

        Otherwise enter SYN-RECEIVED, form a SYN,ACK segment

          <SEQ=ISS><ACK=RCV.NXT><CTL=SYN,ACK>

        and send it.  If there are other controls or text in the
        segment, queue them for processing after the ESTABLISHED state
        has been reached, return.

      fifth, if neither of the SYN or RST bits is set then drop the
      segment and return.

    Otherwise,

      SYN-RECEIVED STATE
      ESTABLISHED STATE
      FIN-WAIT-1 STATE
      FIN-WAIT-2 STATE
      CLOSE-WAIT STATE
      CLOSING STATE
      LAST-ACK STATE
      TIME-WAIT STATE

        Segments are processed in sequence.  Initial tests on arrival
        are used to discard old duplicates, but further processing is
        done in SEG.SEQ order.  If a segment's contents straddle the
        boundary between old and new, only the new parts should be
        processed.

        There are four cases for the acceptability test for an incoming
        segment:

        Segment Receive  Test
        Length  Window
        ------- -------  -------------------------------------------

           0       0     SEG.SEQ = RCV.NXT

           0      >0     RCV.NXT =< SEG.SEQ < RCV.NXT+RCV.WND

          >0       0     not acceptable

          >0      >0     RCV.NXT =< SEG.SEQ < RCV.NXT+RCV.WND
                      or RCV.NXT =< SEG.SEQ+SEG.LEN-1 < RCV.NXT+RCV.WND

        If the RCV.WND is zero, no segments will be acceptable, but
        special allowance should be made to accept valid ACKs, URGs and
        RSTs.

        If an incoming segment is not acceptable, an acknowledgment
        should be sent in reply (unless the RST bit is set, if so drop
        the segment and return):

          <SEQ=SND.NXT><ACK=RCV.NXT><CTL=ACK>

        After sending the acknowledgment, drop the unacceptable segment
        and return.

        In the following it is assumed that the segment is the idealized
        segment that begins at RCV.NXT and does not exceed the window.
        One could tailor actual segments to fit this assumption by
        trimming off any portions that lie outside the window (including
        SYN and FIN), and only processing further if the segment then
        begins at RCV.NXT.  Segments with higher begining sequence
        numbers may be held for later processing.

    second check the RST bit,

      SYN-RECEIVED STATE

        If the RST bit is set

          If this connection was initiated with a passive OPEN (i.e.,
          came from the LISTEN state), then return this connection to
          LISTEN state and return.  The user need not be informed.  If
          this connection was initiated with an active OPEN (i.e., came
          from SYN-SENT state) then the connection was refused, signal
          the user "connection refused".  In either case, all segments
          on the retransmission queue should be removed.  And in the
          active OPEN case, enter the CLOSED state and delete the TCB,
          and return.

      ESTABLISHED
      FIN-WAIT-1
      FIN-WAIT-2
      CLOSE-WAIT

        If the RST bit is set then, any outstanding RECEIVEs and SEND
        should receive "reset" responses.  All segment queues should be
        flushed.  Users should also receive an unsolicited general
        "connection reset" signal.  Enter the CLOSED state, delete the
        TCB, and return.

      CLOSING STATE
      LAST-ACK STATE
      TIME-WAIT

        If the RST bit is set then, enter the CLOSED state, delete the
        TCB, and return.

SEGMENT ARRIVES



    third check security and precedence

      SYN-RECEIVED

        If the security/compartment and precedence in the segment do not
        exactly match the security/compartment and precedence in the TCB
        then send a reset, and return.

      ESTABLISHED STATE

        If the security/compartment and precedence in the segment do not
        exactly match the security/compartment and precedence in the TCB
        then send a reset, any outstanding RECEIVEs and SEND should
        receive "reset" responses.  All segment queues should be
        flushed.  Users should also receive an unsolicited general
        "connection reset" signal.  Enter the CLOSED state, delete the
        TCB, and return.

      Note this check is placed following the sequence check to prevent
      a segment from an old connection between these ports with a
      different security or precedence from causing an abort of the
      current connection.

    fourth, check the SYN bit,

      SYN-RECEIVED
      ESTABLISHED STATE
      FIN-WAIT STATE-1
      FIN-WAIT STATE-2
      CLOSE-WAIT STATE
      CLOSING STATE
      LAST-ACK STATE
      TIME-WAIT STATE

        If the SYN is in the window it is an error, send a reset, any
        outstanding RECEIVEs and SEND should receive "reset" responses,
        all segment queues should be flushed, the user should also
        receive an unsolicited general "connection reset" signal, enter
        the CLOSED state, delete the TCB, and return.

        If the SYN is not in the window this step would not be reached
        and an ack would have been sent in the first step (sequence
        number check).






                                                               [Page 71]

    fifth check the ACK field,

      if the ACK bit is off drop the segment and return

      if the ACK bit is on

        SYN-RECEIVED STATE

          If SND.UNA =< SEG.ACK =< SND.NXT then enter ESTABLISHED state
          and continue processing.

            If the segment acknowledgment is not acceptable, form a
            reset segment,

              <SEQ=SEG.ACK><CTL=RST>

            and send it.

        ESTABLISHED STATE

          If SND.UNA < SEG.ACK =< SND.NXT then, set SND.UNA <- SEG.ACK.
          Any segments on the retransmission queue which are thereby
          entirely acknowledged are removed.  Users should receive
          positive acknowledgments for buffers which have been SENT and
          fully acknowledged (i.e., SEND buffer should be returned with
          "ok" response).  If the ACK is a duplicate
          (SEG.ACK < SND.UNA), it can be ignored.  If the ACK acks
          something not yet sent (SEG.ACK > SND.NXT) then send an ACK,
          drop the segment, and return.

          If SND.UNA < SEG.ACK =< SND.NXT, the send window should be
          updated.  If (SND.WL1 < SEG.SEQ or (SND.WL1 = SEG.SEQ and
          SND.WL2 =< SEG.ACK)), set SND.WND <- SEG.WND, set
          SND.WL1 <- SEG.SEQ, and set SND.WL2 <- SEG.ACK.

          Note that SND.WND is an offset from SND.UNA, that SND.WL1
          records the sequence number of the last segment used to update
          SND.WND, and that SND.WL2 records the acknowledgment number of
          the last segment used to update SND.WND.  The check here
          prevents using old segments to update the window.

SEGMENT ARRIVES



        FIN-WAIT-1 STATE

          In addition to the processing for the ESTABLISHED state, if
          our FIN is now acknowledged then enter FIN-WAIT-2 and continue
          processing in that state.

        FIN-WAIT-2 STATE

          In addition to the processing for the ESTABLISHED state, if
          the retransmission queue is empty, the user's CLOSE can be
          acknowledged ("ok") but do not delete the TCB.

        CLOSE-WAIT STATE

          Do the same processing as for the ESTABLISHED state.

        CLOSING STATE

          In addition to the processing for the ESTABLISHED state, if
          the ACK acknowledges our FIN then enter the TIME-WAIT state,
          otherwise ignore the segment.

        LAST-ACK STATE

          The only thing that can arrive in this state is an
          acknowledgment of our FIN.  If our FIN is now acknowledged,
          delete the TCB, enter the CLOSED state, and return.

        TIME-WAIT STATE

          The only thing that can arrive in this state is a
          retransmission of the remote FIN.  Acknowledge it, and restart
          the 2 MSL timeout.

    sixth, check the URG bit,

      ESTABLISHED STATE
      FIN-WAIT-1 STATE
      FIN-WAIT-2 STATE

        If the URG bit is set, RCV.UP <- max(RCV.UP,SEG.UP), and signal
        the user that the remote side has urgent data if the urgent
        pointer (RCV.UP) is in advance of the data consumed.  If the
        user has already been signaled (or is still in the "urgent
        mode") for this continuous sequence of urgent data, do not
        signal the user again.



                                                               [Page 73]

                                                         SEGMENT ARRIVES



      CLOSE-WAIT STATE
      CLOSING STATE
      LAST-ACK STATE
      TIME-WAIT

        This should not occur, since a FIN has been received from the
        remote side.  Ignore the URG.

    seventh, process the segment text,

      ESTABLISHED STATE
      FIN-WAIT-1 STATE
      FIN-WAIT-2 STATE

        Once in the ESTABLISHED state, it is possible to deliver segment
        text to user RECEIVE buffers.  Text from segments can be moved
        into buffers until either the buffer is full or the segment is
        empty.  If the segment empties and carries an PUSH flag, then
        the user is informed, when the buffer is returned, that a PUSH
        has been received.

        When the TCP takes responsibility for delivering the data to the
        user it must also acknowledge the receipt of the data.

        Once the TCP takes responsibility for the data it advances
        RCV.NXT over the data accepted, and adjusts RCV.WND as
        apporopriate to the current buffer availability.  The total of
        RCV.NXT and RCV.WND should not be reduced.

        Please note the window management suggestions in section 3.7.

        Send an acknowledgment of the form:

          <SEQ=SND.NXT><ACK=RCV.NXT><CTL=ACK>

        This acknowledgment should be piggybacked on a segment being
        transmitted if possible without incurring undue delay.

        This should not occur, since a FIN has been received from the
        remote side.  Ignore the segment text.

    eighth, check the FIN bit,

      Do not process the FIN if the state is CLOSED, LISTEN or SYN-SENT
      since the SEG.SEQ cannot be validated; drop the segment and
      return.

      If the FIN bit is set, signal the user "connection closing" and
      return any pending RECEIVEs with same message, advance RCV.NXT
      over the FIN, and send an acknowledgment for the FIN.  Note that
      FIN implies PUSH for any segment text not yet delivered to the
      user.

        SYN-RECEIVED STATE
        ESTABLISHED STATE

          Enter the CLOSE-WAIT state.

        FIN-WAIT-1 STATE

          If our FIN has been ACKed (perhaps in this segment), then
          enter TIME-WAIT, start the time-wait timer, turn off the other
          timers; otherwise enter the CLOSING state.

        FIN-WAIT-2 STATE

          Enter the TIME-WAIT state.  Start the time-wait timer, turn
          off the other timers.

        CLOSE-WAIT STATE

          Remain in the CLOSE-WAIT state.

        CLOSING STATE

          Remain in the CLOSING state.

        LAST-ACK STATE

          Remain in the LAST-ACK state.

receive window
          This represents the sequence numbers the local (receiving) TCP
          is willing to receive.  Thus, the local TCP considers that
          segments overlapping the range RCV.NXT to
          RCV.NXT + RCV.WND - 1 carry acceptable data or control.
          Segments containing sequence numbers entirely outside of this

RST
          A control bit (reset), occupying no sequence space, indicating
          that the receiver should delete the connection without further
          interaction.  The receiver can determine, based on the
          sequence number and acknowledgment fields of the incoming
          segment, whether it should honor the reset command or ignore
          it.  In no case does receipt of a segment containing RST give

SEG.WND
          segment window field

segment
          A logical unit of data, in particular a TCP segment is the
          unit of data transfered between a pair of TCP modules.

segment acknowledgment
          The sequence number in the acknowledgment field of the
          arriving segment.

segment length
          The amount of sequence number space occupied by a segment,
          including any controls which occupy sequence space.

segment sequence
          The number in the sequence field of the arriving segment.

send sequence
          This is the next sequence number the local (sending) TCP will
          use on the connection.  It is initially selected from an
          initial sequence number curve (ISN) and is incremented for
          each octet of data or sequenced control transmitted.

send window
          This represents the sequence numbers which the remote
          (receiving) TCP is willing to receive.  It is the value of the
          window field specified in segments from the remote (data
          receiving) TCP.  The range of new sequence numbers which may
          be emitted by a TCP lies between SND.NXT and
          SND.UNA + SND.WND - 1. (Retransmissions of sequence numbers

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


1.  Introduction

   The comma separated values format (CSV) has been used for exchanging
   and converting data between various spreadsheet programs for quite
   some time.  Surprisingly, while this format is very common, it has
   never been formally documented.  Additionally, while the IANA MIME
   registration tree includes a registration for
   "text/tab-separated-values" type, no MIME types have ever been
   registered with IANA for CSV.  At the same time, various programs and
   operating systems have begun to use different MIME types for this
   format.  This RFC documents the format of comma separated values
   (CSV) files and formally registers the "text/csv" MIME type for CSV
   in accordance with RFC 2048 [1].

2.  Definition of the CSV Format

   While there are various specifications and implementations for the
   CSV format (for ex. [4], [5], [6] and [7]), there is no formal
   specification in existence, which allows for a wide variety of
   interpretations of CSV files.  This section documents the format that
   seems to be followed by most implementations:

   1.  Each record is located on a separate line, delimited by a line
       break (CRLF).  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF

   2.  The last record in the file may or may not have an ending line
       break.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   3.  There maybe an optional header line appearing as the first line
       of the file with the same format as normal record lines.  This
       header will contain names corresponding to the fields in the file
       and should contain the same number of fields as the records in
       the rest of the file (the presence or absence of the header line
       should be indicated via the optional "header" parameter of this
       MIME type).  For example:

       field_name,field_name,field_name CRLF
       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF






Shafranovich                 Informational                      [Page 2]

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


   4.  Within the header and each record, there may be one or more
       fields, separated by commas.  Each line should contain the same
       number of fields throughout the file.  Spaces are considered part
       of a field and should not be ignored.  The last field in the
       record must not be followed by a comma.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc

   5.  Each field may or may not be enclosed in double quotes (however
       some programs, such as Microsoft Excel, do not use double quotes
       at all).  If fields are not enclosed with double quotes, then
       double quotes may not appear inside the fields.  For example:

       "aaa","bbb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   6.  Fields containing line breaks (CRLF), double quotes, and commas
       should be enclosed in double-quotes.  For example:

       "aaa","b CRLF
       bb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   7.  If double-quotes are used to enclose fields, then a double-quote
       appearing inside a field must be escaped by preceding it with
       another double quote.  For example:

       "aaa","b""bb","ccc"

   The ABNF grammar [2] appears as follows:

   file = [header CRLF] record *(CRLF record) [CRLF]

   header = name *(COMMA name)

   record = field *(COMMA field)

   name = field

   field = (escaped / non-escaped)

   escaped = DQUOTE *(TEXTDATA / COMMA / CR / LF / 2DQUOTE) DQUOTE

   non-escaped = *TEXTDATA

   COMMA = %x2C

   CR = %x0D ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


   DQUOTE =  %x22 ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   LF = %x0A ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   CRLF = CR LF ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   TEXTDATA =  %x20-21 / %x23-2B / %x2D-7E

3.  MIME Type Registration of text/csv

   This section provides the media-type registration application (as per
   RFC 2048 [1].

   To: ietf-types@iana.org

   Subject: Registration of MIME media type text/csv

   MIME media type name: text

   MIME subtype name: csv

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: charset, header

      Common usage of CSV is US-ASCII, but other character sets defined
      by IANA for the "text" tree may be used in conjunction with the
      "charset" parameter.

      The "header" parameter indicates the presence or absence of the
      header line.  Valid values are "present" or "absent".
      Implementors choosing not to use this parameter must make their
      own decisions as to whether the header line is present or absent.

   Encoding considerations:

      As per section 4.1.1. of RFC 2046 [3], this media type uses CRLF
      to denote line breaks.  However, implementors should be aware that
      some implementations may use other values.

   Security considerations:

      CSV files contain passive text data that should not pose any
      risks.  However, it is possible in theory that malicious binary
      data may be included in order to exploit potential buffer overruns
      in the program processing CSV data.  Additionally, private data
      may be shared via this format (which of course applies to any text
      data).

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005


   Interoperability considerations:

      Due to lack of a single specification, there are considerable
      differences among implementations.  Implementors should "be
      conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from
      others" (RFC 793 [8]) when processing CSV files.  An attempt at a
      common definition can be found in Section 2.

      Implementations deciding not to use the optional "header"
      parameter must make their own decision as to whether the header is
      absent or present.

   Published specification:

      While numerous private specifications exist for various programs
      and systems, there is no single "master" specification for this
      format.  An attempt at a common definition can be found in Section
      2.

   Applications that use this media type:

      Spreadsheet programs and various data conversion utilities

   Additional information:

      Magic number(s): none

      File extension(s): CSV

      Macintosh File Type Code(s): TEXT

1.   INTRODUCTION

   Internet technical specifications often need to define a format
   syntax and are free to employ whatever notation their authors deem
   useful.  Over the years, a modified version of Backus-Naur Form
   (BNF), called Augmented BNF (ABNF), has been popular among many
   Internet specifications.  It balances compactness and simplicity,
   with reasonable representational power.  In the early days of the
   Arpanet, each specification contained its own definition of ABNF.
   This included the email specifications, RFC733 and then RFC822 which
   have come to be the common citations for defining ABNF.  The current
   document separates out that definition, to permit selective
   reference.  Predictably, it also provides some modifications and
   enhancements.

   The differences between standard BNF and ABNF involve naming rules,
   repetition, alternatives, order-independence, and value ranges.
   Appendix A (Core) supplies rule definitions and encoding for a core
   lexical analyzer of the type common to several Internet
   specifications.  It is provided as a convenience and is otherwise
   separate from the meta language defined in the body of this document,
   and separate from its formal status.

2.   RULE DEFINITION

2.1  Rule Naming

   The name of a rule is simply the name itself; that is, a sequence of
   characters, beginning with  an alphabetic character, and followed by
   a combination of alphabetics, digits and hyphens (dashes).

        NOTE:     Rule names are case-insensitive

   The names <rulename>, <Rulename>, <RULENAME> and <rUlENamE> all refer
   to the same rule.

RFC 2234             ABNF for Syntax Specifications        November 1997


   Unlike original BNF, angle brackets ("<", ">") are not  required.
   However, angle brackets may be used around a rule name whenever their
   presence will facilitate discerning the use of  a rule name.  This is
   typically restricted to rule name references in free-form prose, or
   to distinguish partial rules that combine into a string not separated
   by white space, such as shown in the discussion about repetition,
   below.

2.2  Rule Form

   A rule is defined by the following sequence:

        name =  elements crlf

   where <name> is the name of the rule, <elements> is one or more rule
   names or terminal specifications and <crlf> is the end-of- line
   indicator, carriage return followed by line feed.  The equal sign
   separates the name from the definition of the rule.  The elements
   form a sequence of one or more rule names and/or value definitions,
   combined according to the various operators, defined in this
   document, such as alternative and repetition.

   For visual ease, rule definitions are left aligned.  When a rule
   requires multiple lines, the continuation lines are indented.  The
   left alignment and indentation are relative to the first lines of the
   ABNF rules and need not match the left margin of the document.

2.3  Terminal Values

   Rules resolve into a string of terminal values, sometimes called
   characters.  In ABNF a character is merely a non-negative integer.
   In certain contexts a specific mapping (encoding) of values into a
   character set (such as ASCII) will be specified.

   Terminals are specified by one or more numeric characters with the
   base interpretation of those characters indicated explicitly.  The
   following bases are currently defined:

        b           =  binary

        d           =  decimal

        x           =  hexadecimal








Crocker & Overell           Standards Track                     [Page 3]

RFC 2234             ABNF for Syntax Specifications        November 1997


   Hence:

        CR          =  %d13

        CR          =  %x0D

   respectively specify the decimal and hexadecimal representation of
   [US-ASCII] for carriage return.

   A concatenated string of such values is specified compactly, using a
   period (".") to indicate separation of characters within that value.
   Hence:

        CRLF        =  %d13.10

   ABNF permits specifying literal text string directly, enclosed in
   quotation-marks.  Hence:

        command     =  "command string"

   Literal text strings are interpreted as a concatenated set of
   printable characters.

        NOTE:     ABNF strings are case-insensitive and
                  the character set for these strings is us-ascii.

   Hence:

        rulename = "abc"

   and:

        rulename = "aBc"

   will match "abc", "Abc", "aBc", "abC", "ABc", "aBC", "AbC" and "ABC".

                To specify a rule which IS case SENSITIVE,
                   specify the characters individually.

   For example:

        rulename    =  %d97 %d98 %d99

   or

        rulename    =  %d97.98.99





Crocker & Overell           Standards Track                     [Page 4]

RFC 2234             ABNF for Syntax Specifications        November 1997


   will match only the string which comprises only lowercased
   characters, abc.

2.4  External Encodings

   External representations of terminal value characters will vary
   according to constraints in the storage or transmission environment.
   Hence, the same ABNF-based grammar may have multiple external
   encodings, such as one for a 7-bit US-ASCII environment, another for
   a binary octet environment and still a different one when 16-bit
   Unicode is used.  Encoding details are beyond the scope of ABNF,
   although Appendix A (Core) provides definitions for a 7-bit US-ASCII
   environment as has been common to much of the Internet.

   By separating external encoding from the syntax, it is intended that
   alternate encoding environments can be used for the same syntax.

3.   OPERATORS

3.1  Concatenation                                  Rule1 Rule2

   A rule can define a simple, ordered string of values -- i.e., a
   concatenation of contiguous characters -- by listing a sequence of
   rule names.  For example:

        foo         =  %x61           ; a

        bar         =  %x62           ; b

        mumble      =  foo bar foo

        So that the rule <mumble> matches the lowercase string "aba".

        LINEAR WHITE SPACE:  Concatenation is at the core of the ABNF
        parsing model.  A string of contiguous characters (values) is
        parsed according to the rules defined in ABNF.  For Internet
        specifications, there is some history of permitting linear white
        space (space and horizontal tab) to be freelyPand
        implicitlyPinterspersed around major constructs, such as
        delimiting special characters or atomic strings.

        NOTE:     This specification for ABNF does not
                  provide for implicit specification of linear white
                  space.

   Any grammar which wishes to permit linear white space around
   delimiters or string segments must specify it explicitly.  It is
   often useful to provide for such white space in "core" rules that are



Crocker & Overell           Standards Track                     [Page 5]

RFC 2234             ABNF for Syntax Specifications        November 1997


   then used variously among higher-level rules.  The "core" rules might
   be formed into a lexical analyzer or simply be part of the main
   ruleset.

3.2  Alternatives                               Rule1 / Rule2

   Elements separated by forward slash ("/") are alternatives.
   Therefore,

        foo / bar

   will accept <foo> or <bar>.

        NOTE:     A quoted string containing alphabetic
                  characters is special form for specifying alternative
                  characters and is interpreted as a non-terminal
                  representing the set of combinatorial strings with the
                  contained characters, in the specified order but with
                  any mixture of upper and lower case..

3.3  Incremental Alternatives                    Rule1 =/ Rule2

   It is sometimes convenient to specify a list of alternatives in
   fragments.  That is, an initial rule may match one or more
   alternatives, with later rule definitions adding to the set of
   alternatives.  This is particularly useful for otherwise- independent
   specifications which derive from the same parent rule set, such as
   often occurs with parameter lists.  ABNF permits this incremental
   definition through the construct:

        oldrule     =/ additional-alternatives

   So that the rule set

        ruleset     =  alt1 / alt2

        ruleset     =/ alt3

        ruleset     =/ alt4 / alt5

   is the same as specifying

        ruleset     =  alt1 / alt2 / alt3 / alt4 / alt5








Crocker & Overell           Standards Track                     [Page 6]

RFC 2234             ABNF for Syntax Specifications        November 1997


3.4  Value Range Alternatives                           %c##-##

   A range of alternative numeric values can be specified compactly,
   using dash ("-") to indicate the range of alternative values.  Hence:

        DIGIT       =  %x30-39

   is equivalent to:

        DIGIT       =  "0" / "1" / "2" / "3" / "4" / "5" / "6" /

                           "7" / "8" / "9"

   Concatenated numeric values and numeric value ranges can not be
   specified in the same string.  A numeric value may use the dotted
   notation for concatenation or it may use the dash notation to specify
   one value range.  Hence, to specify one printable character, between
   end of line sequences, the specification could be:

        char-line = %x0D.0A %x20-7E %x0D.0A

3.5  Sequence Group                             (Rule1 Rule2)

   Elements enclosed in parentheses are treated as a single element,
   whose contents are STRICTLY ORDERED.   Thus,

        elem (foo / bar) blat

   which matches (elem foo blat) or (elem bar blat).

        elem foo / bar blat

   matches (elem foo) or (bar blat).

        NOTE:     It is strongly advised to use grouping
                  notation, rather than to rely on proper reading of
                  "bare" alternations, when alternatives consist of
                  multiple rule names or literals.

   Hence it is recommended that instead of the above form, the form:

        (elem foo) / (bar blat)

   be used.  It will avoid misinterpretation by casual readers.

   The sequence group notation is also used within free text to set off
   an element sequence from the prose.

RFC 2234             ABNF for Syntax Specifications        November 1997


3.6  Variable Repetition                                *Rule

   The operator "*" preceding an element indicates repetition. The full
   form is:

        <a>*<b>element

   where <a> and <b> are optional decimal values, indicating at least
   <a> and at most <b> occurrences of element.

   Default values are 0 and infinity so that *<element> allows any
   number, including zero; 1*<element> requires at  least  one;
   3*3<element> allows exactly 3 and 1*2<element> allows one or two.

3.7  Specific Repetition                                  nRule

   A rule of the form:

        <n>element

   is equivalent to

        <n>*<n>element

   That is, exactly  <N>  occurrences  of <element>. Thus 2DIGIT is a
   2-digit number, and 3ALPHA is a string of three alphabetic
   characters.

3.8  Optional Sequence                                   [RULE]

   Square brackets enclose an optional element sequence:

        [foo bar]

   is equivalent to

        *1(foo bar).

3.9  ; Comment

   A semi-colon starts a comment that continues to the end of line.
   This is a simple way of including useful notes in parallel with the
   specifications.

RFC 2234             ABNF for Syntax Specifications        November 1997


3.10 Operator Precedence

   The various mechanisms described above have the following precedence,
   from highest (binding tightest) at the top, to lowest and loosest at
   the bottom:

        Strings, Names formation
        Comment
        Value range
        Repetition
        Grouping, Optional
        Concatenation
        Alternative

   Use of the alternative operator, freely mixed with concatenations can
   be confusing.

        Again, it is recommended that the grouping operator be used to
        make explicit concatenation groups.

        comment        =  ";" *(WSP / VCHAR) CRLF

6.   APPENDIX A - CORE

   This Appendix is provided as a convenient core for specific grammars.
   The definitions may be used as a core set of rules.

6.1  Core Rules

   Certain  basic  rules  are  in uppercase, such as SP, HTAB, CRLF,
   DIGIT, ALPHA, etc.

        ALPHA          =  %x41-5A / %x61-7A   ; A-Z / a-z

        BIT            =  "0" / "1"

        CHAR           =  %x01-7F
                               ; any 7-bit US-ASCII character,
                                  excluding NUL

        CR             =  %x0D
                               ; carriage return

        CRLF           =  CR LF
                               ; Internet standard newline

        CTL            =  %x00-1F / %x7F
                               ; controls

        DIGIT          =  %x30-39
                               ; 0-9

        DQUOTE         =  %x22
                               ; " (Double Quote)

        HEXDIG         =  DIGIT / "A" / "B" / "C" / "D" / "E" / "F"

        HTAB           =  %x09
                               ; horizontal tab

        LF             =  %x0A
                               ; linefeed

        LWSP           =  *(WSP / CRLF WSP)
                               ; linear white space (past newline)

        OCTET          =  %x00-FF
                               ; 8 bits of data

        SP             =  %x20

        WSP            =  SP / HTAB
                               ; white space

6.2  Common Encoding

   Externally, data are represented as "network virtual ASCII", namely
   7-bit US-ASCII in an 8-bit field, with the high (8th) bit set to
   zero.  A string of values is in "network byte order" with the
   higher-valued bytes represented on the left-hand side and being sent
   over the network first.

7.   ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

   The syntax for ABNF was originally specified in RFC 733.  Ken L.
   Harrenstien, of SRI International, was responsible for re-coding the
   BNF into an augmented BNF that makes the representation smaller and
   easier to understand.

   This recent project began as a simple effort to cull out the portion
   of RFC 822 which has been repeatedly cited by non-email specification
   writers, namely the description of augmented BNF.  Rather than simply
   and blindly converting the existing text into a separate document,
   the working group chose to give careful consideration to the
   deficiencies, as well as benefits, of the existing specification and
   related specifications available over the last 15 years and therefore
   to pursue enhancement.  This turned the project into something rather
   more ambitious than first intended.  Interestingly the result is not
   massively different from that original, although decisions such as
   removing the list notation came as a surprise.

   The current round of specification was part of the DRUMS working
   group, with significant contributions from Jerome Abela , Harald
   Alvestrand, Robert Elz, Roger Fajman, Aviva Garrett, Tom Harsch, Dan
   Kohn, Bill McQuillan, Keith Moore, Chris Newman , Pete Resnick and
   Henning Schulzrinne.

Status of this Memo

   This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
   Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet
   Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state
   and status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

Abstract

   STD 11, RFC 822 defines a message representation protocol specifying
   considerable detail about US-ASCII message headers, but which leaves
   the message content, or message body, as flat US-ASCII text.  This
   set of documents, collectively called the Multipurpose Internet Mail
   Extensions, or MIME, redefines the format of messages to allow for

    (1)   textual message bodies in character sets other than
          US-ASCII,

    (2)   an extensible set of different formats for non-textual
          message bodies,

    (3)   multi-part message bodies, and

    (4)   textual header information in character sets other than
          US-ASCII.

   These documents are based on earlier work documented in RFC 934, STD
   11, and RFC 1049, but extends and revises them.  Because RFC 822 said
   so little about message bodies, these documents are largely
   orthogonal to (rather than a revision of) RFC 822.

   The initial document in this set, RFC 2045, specifies the various
   headers used to describe the structure of MIME messages. This second
   document defines the general structure of the MIME media typing
   system and defines an initial set of media types. The third document,
   RFC 2047, describes extensions to RFC 822 to allow non-US-ASCII text

   data in Internet mail header fields. The fourth document, RFC 2048,
   specifies various IANA registration procedures for MIME-related
   facilities.  The fifth and final document, RFC 2049, describes MIME
   conformance criteria as well as providing some illustrative examples
   of MIME message formats, acknowledgements, and the bibliography.

   These documents are revisions of RFCs 1521 and 1522, which themselves
   were revisions of RFCs 1341 and 1342.  An appendix in RFC 2049
   describes differences and changes from previous versions.

1.  Introduction

   The first document in this set, RFC 2045, defines a number of header
   fields, including Content-Type. The Content-Type field is used to
   specify the nature of the data in the body of a MIME entity, by
   giving media type and subtype identifiers, and by providing auxiliary
   information that may be required for certain media types.  After the
   type and subtype names, the remainder of the header field is simply a
   set of parameters, specified in an attribute/value notation.  The
   ordering of parameters is not significant.

   In general, the top-level media type is used to declare the general
   type of data, while the subtype specifies a specific format for that
   type of data.  Thus, a media type of "image/xyz" is enough to tell a
   user agent that the data is an image, even if the user agent has no
   knowledge of the specific image format "xyz".  Such information can
   be used, for example, to decide whether or not to show a user the raw
   data from an unrecognized subtype -- such an action might be
   reasonable for unrecognized subtypes of "text", but not for
   unrecognized subtypes of "image" or "audio".  For this reason,
   registered subtypes of "text", "image", "audio", and "video" should
   not contain embedded information that is really of a different type.
   Such compound formats should be represented using the "multipart" or
   "application" types.

   Parameters are modifiers of the media subtype, and as such do not
   fundamentally affect the nature of the content.  The set of
   meaningful parameters depends on the media type and subtype.  Most
   parameters are associated with a single specific subtype.  However, a
   given top-level media type may define parameters which are applicable
   to any subtype of that type.  Parameters may be required by their
   defining media type or subtype or they may be optional.  MIME
   implementations must also ignore any parameters whose names they do
   not recognize.

   MIME's Content-Type header field and media type mechanism has been
   carefully designed to be extensible, and it is expected that the set
   of media type/subtype pairs and their associated parameters will grow
   significantly over time.  Several other MIME facilities, such as
   transfer encodings and "message/external-body" access types, are
   likely to have new values defined over time.  In order to ensure that
   the set of such values is developed in an orderly, well-specified,
   and public manner, MIME sets up a registration process which uses the
   Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) as a central registry for
   MIME's various areas of extensibility.  The registration process for
   these areas is described in a companion document, RFC 2048.

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


   The initial seven standard top-level media type are defined and
   described in the remainder of this document.

2.  Definition of a Top-Level Media Type

   The definition of a top-level media type consists of:

    (1)   a name and a description of the type, including
          criteria for whether a particular type would qualify
          under that type,

    (2)   the names and definitions of parameters, if any, which
          are defined for all subtypes of that type (including
          whether such parameters are required or optional),

    (3)   how a user agent and/or gateway should handle unknown
          subtypes of this type,

    (4)   general considerations on gatewaying entities of this
          top-level type, if any, and

    (5)   any restrictions on content-transfer-encodings for
          entities of this top-level type.

3.  Overview Of The Initial Top-Level Media Types

   The five discrete top-level media types are:

    (1)   text -- textual information.  The subtype "plain" in
          particular indicates plain text containing no
          formatting commands or directives of any sort. Plain
          text is intended to be displayed "as-is". No special
          software is required to get the full meaning of the
          text, aside from support for the indicated character
          set. Other subtypes are to be used for enriched text in
          forms where application software may enhance the
          appearance of the text, but such software must not be
          required in order to get the general idea of the
          content.  Possible subtypes of "text" thus include any
          word processor format that can be read without
          resorting to software that understands the format.  In
          particular, formats that employ embeddded binary
          formatting information are not considered directly
          readable. A very simple and portable subtype,
          "richtext", was defined in RFC 1341, with a further
          revision in RFC 1896 under the name "enriched".





Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                     [Page 4]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


    (2)   image -- image data.  "Image" requires a display device
          (such as a graphical display, a graphics printer, or a
          FAX machine) to view the information. An initial
          subtype is defined for the widely-used image format
          JPEG. .  subtypes are defined for two widely-used image
          formats, jpeg and gif.

    (3)   audio -- audio data.  "Audio" requires an audio output
          device (such as a speaker or a telephone) to "display"
          the contents.  An initial subtype "basic" is defined in
          this document.

    (4)   video -- video data.  "Video" requires the capability
          to display moving images, typically including
          specialized hardware and software.  An initial subtype
          "mpeg" is defined in this document.

    (5)   application -- some other kind of data, typically
          either uninterpreted binary data or information to be
          processed by an application.  The subtype "octet-
          stream" is to be used in the case of uninterpreted
          binary data, in which case the simplest recommended
          action is to offer to write the information into a file
          for the user.  The "PostScript" subtype is also defined
          for the transport of PostScript material.  Other
          expected uses for "application" include spreadsheets,
          data for mail-based scheduling systems, and languages
          for "active" (computational) messaging, and word
          processing formats that are not directly readable.
          Note that security considerations may exist for some
          types of application data, most notably
          "application/PostScript" and any form of active
          messaging.  These issues are discussed later in this
          document.

   The two composite top-level media types are:

    (1)   multipart -- data consisting of multiple entities of
          independent data types.  Four subtypes are initially
          defined, including the basic "mixed" subtype specifying
          a generic mixed set of parts, "alternative" for
          representing the same data in multiple formats,
          "parallel" for parts intended to be viewed
          simultaneously, and "digest" for multipart entities in
          which each part has a default type of "message/rfc822".






Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                     [Page 5]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


    (2)   message -- an encapsulated message.  A body of media
          type "message" is itself all or a portion of some kind
          of message object.  Such objects may or may not in turn
          contain other entities.  The "rfc822" subtype is used
          when the encapsulated content is itself an RFC 822
          message.  The "partial" subtype is defined for partial
          RFC 822 messages, to permit the fragmented transmission
          of bodies that are thought to be too large to be passed
          through transport facilities in one piece.  Another
          subtype, "external-body", is defined for specifying
          large bodies by reference to an external data source.

   It should be noted that the list of media type values given here may
   be augmented in time, via the mechanisms described above, and that
   the set of subtypes is expected to grow substantially.

4.  Discrete Media Type Values

   Five of the seven initial media type values refer to discrete bodies.
   The content of these types must be handled by non-MIME mechanisms;
   they are opaque to MIME processors.

4.1.  Text Media Type

   The "text" media type is intended for sending material which is
   principally textual in form.  A "charset" parameter may be used to
   indicate the character set of the body text for "text" subtypes,
   notably including the subtype "text/plain", which is a generic
   subtype for plain text.  Plain text does not provide for or allow
   formatting commands, font attribute specifications, processing
   instructions, interpretation directives, or content markup.  Plain
   text is seen simply as a linear sequence of characters, possibly
   interrupted by line breaks or page breaks.  Plain text may allow the
   stacking of several characters in the same position in the text.
   Plain text in scripts like Arabic and Hebrew may also include
   facilitites that allow the arbitrary mixing of text segments with
   opposite writing directions.

   Beyond plain text, there are many formats for representing what might
   be known as "rich text".  An interesting characteristic of many such
   representations is that they are to some extent readable even without
   the software that interprets them.  It is useful, then, to
   distinguish them, at the highest level, from such unreadable data as
   images, audio, or text represented in an unreadable form. In the
   absence of appropriate interpretation software, it is reasonable to
   show subtypes of "text" to the user, while it is not reasonable to do
   so with most nontextual data. Such formatted textual data should be
   represented using subtypes of "text".



Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                     [Page 6]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


4.1.1.  Representation of Line Breaks

   The canonical form of any MIME "text" subtype MUST always represent a
   line break as a CRLF sequence.  Similarly, any occurrence of CRLF in
   MIME "text" MUST represent a line break.  Use of CR and LF outside of
   line break sequences is also forbidden.

   This rule applies regardless of format or character set or sets
   involved.

   NOTE: The proper interpretation of line breaks when a body is
   displayed depends on the media type. In particular, while it is
   appropriate to treat a line break as a transition to a new line when
   displaying a "text/plain" body, this treatment is actually incorrect
   for other subtypes of "text" like "text/enriched" [RFC-1896].
   Similarly, whether or not line breaks should be added during display
   operations is also a function of the media type. It should not be
   necessary to add any line breaks to display "text/plain" correctly,
   whereas proper display of "text/enriched" requires the appropriate
   addition of line breaks.

   NOTE: Some protocols defines a maximum line length.  E.g. SMTP [RFC-
   821] allows a maximum of 998 octets before the next CRLF sequence.
   To be transported by such protocols, data which includes too long
   segments without CRLF sequences must be encoded with a suitable
   content-transfer-encoding.

4.1.2.  Charset Parameter

   A critical parameter that may be specified in the Content-Type field
   for "text/plain" data is the character set.  This is specified with a
   "charset" parameter, as in:

     Content-type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1

   Unlike some other parameter values, the values of the charset
   parameter are NOT case sensitive.  The default character set, which
   must be assumed in the absence of a charset parameter, is US-ASCII.

   The specification for any future subtypes of "text" must specify
   whether or not they will also utilize a "charset" parameter, and may
   possibly restrict its values as well.  For other subtypes of "text"
   than "text/plain", the semantics of the "charset" parameter should be
   defined to be identical to those specified here for "text/plain",
   i.e., the body consists entirely of characters in the given charset.
   In particular, definers of future "text" subtypes should pay close
   attention to the implications of multioctet character sets for their
   subtype definitions.



Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                     [Page 7]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


   The charset parameter for subtypes of "text" gives a name of a
   character set, as "character set" is defined in RFC 2045.  The rules
   regarding line breaks detailed in the previous section must also be
   observed -- a character set whose definition does not conform to
   these rules cannot be used in a MIME "text" subtype.

   An initial list of predefined character set names can be found at the
   end of this section.  Additional character sets may be registered
   with IANA.

   Other media types than subtypes of "text" might choose to employ the
   charset parameter as defined here, but with the CRLF/line break
   restriction removed.  Therefore, all character sets that conform to
   the general definition of "character set" in RFC 2045 can be
   registered for MIME use.

   Note that if the specified character set includes 8-bit characters
   and such characters are used in the body, a Content-Transfer-Encoding
   header field and a corresponding encoding on the data are required in
   order to transmit the body via some mail transfer protocols, such as
   SMTP [RFC-821].

   The default character set, US-ASCII, has been the subject of some
   confusion and ambiguity in the past.  Not only were there some
   ambiguities in the definition, there have been wide variations in
   practice.  In order to eliminate such ambiguity and variations in the
   future, it is strongly recommended that new user agents explicitly
   specify a character set as a media type parameter in the Content-Type
   header field. "US-ASCII" does not indicate an arbitrary 7-bit
   character set, but specifies that all octets in the body must be
   interpreted as characters according to the US-ASCII character set.
   National and application-oriented versions of ISO 646 [ISO-646] are
   usually NOT identical to US-ASCII, and in that case their use in
   Internet mail is explicitly discouraged.  The omission of the ISO 646
   character set from this document is deliberate in this regard.  The
   character set name of "US-ASCII" explicitly refers to the character
   set defined in ANSI X3.4-1986 [US- ASCII].  The new international
   reference version (IRV) of the 1991 edition of ISO 646 is identical
   to US-ASCII.  The character set name "ASCII" is reserved and must not
   be used for any purpose.

   NOTE: RFC 821 explicitly specifies "ASCII", and references an earlier
   version of the American Standard.  Insofar as one of the purposes of
   specifying a media type and character set is to permit the receiver
   to unambiguously determine how the sender intended the coded message
   to be interpreted, assuming anything other than "strict ASCII" as the
   default would risk unintentional and incompatible changes to the
   semantics of messages now being transmitted.  This also implies that



Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                     [Page 8]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


   messages containing characters coded according to other versions of
   ISO 646 than US-ASCII and the 1991 IRV, or using code-switching
   procedures (e.g., those of ISO 2022), as well as 8bit or multiple
   octet character encodings MUST use an appropriate character set
   specification to be consistent with MIME.

   The complete US-ASCII character set is listed in ANSI X3.4- 1986.
   Note that the control characters including DEL (0-31, 127) have no
   defined meaning in apart from the combination CRLF (US-ASCII values
   13 and 10) indicating a new line.  Two of the characters have de
   facto meanings in wide use: FF (12) often means "start subsequent
   text on the beginning of a new page"; and TAB or HT (9) often (though
   not always) means "move the cursor to the next available column after
   the current position where the column number is a multiple of 8
   (counting the first column as column 0)."  Aside from these
   conventions, any use of the control characters or DEL in a body must
   either occur

    (1)   because a subtype of text other than "plain"
          specifically assigns some additional meaning, or

    (2)   within the context of a private agreement between the
          sender and recipient. Such private agreements are
          discouraged and should be replaced by the other
          capabilities of this document.

   NOTE: An enormous proliferation of character sets exist beyond US-
   ASCII.  A large number of partially or totally overlapping character
   sets is NOT a good thing.  A SINGLE character set that can be used
   universally for representing all of the world's languages in Internet
   mail would be preferrable.  Unfortunately, existing practice in
   several communities seems to point to the continued use of multiple
   character sets in the near future.  A small number of standard
   character sets are, therefore, defined for Internet use in this
   document.

   The defined charset values are:

    (1)   US-ASCII -- as defined in ANSI X3.4-1986 [US-ASCII].

    (2)   ISO-8859-X -- where "X" is to be replaced, as
          necessary, for the parts of ISO-8859 [ISO-8859].  Note
          that the ISO 646 character sets have deliberately been
          omitted in favor of their 8859 replacements, which are
          the designated character sets for Internet mail.  As of
          the publication of this document, the legitimate values
          for "X" are the digits 1 through 10.




Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                     [Page 9]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


   Characters in the range 128-159 has no assigned meaning in ISO-8859-
   X.  Characters with values below 128 in ISO-8859-X have the same
   assigned meaning as they do in US-ASCII.

   Part 6 of ISO 8859 (Latin/Arabic alphabet) and part 8 (Latin/Hebrew
   alphabet) includes both characters for which the normal writing
   direction is right to left and characters for which it is left to
   right, but do not define a canonical ordering method for representing
   bi-directional text.  The charset values "ISO-8859-6" and "ISO-8859-
   8", however, specify that the visual method is used [RFC-1556].

   All of these character sets are used as pure 7bit or 8bit sets
   without any shift or escape functions.  The meaning of shift and
   escape sequences in these character sets is not defined.

   The character sets specified above are the ones that were relatively
   uncontroversial during the drafting of MIME.  This document does not
   endorse the use of any particular character set other than US-ASCII,
   and recognizes that the future evolution of world character sets
   remains unclear.

   Note that the character set used, if anything other than US- ASCII,
   must always be explicitly specified in the Content-Type field.

   No character set name other than those defined above may be used in
   Internet mail without the publication of a formal specification and
   its registration with IANA, or by private agreement, in which case
   the character set name must begin with "X-".

   Implementors are discouraged from defining new character sets unless
   absolutely necessary.

   The "charset" parameter has been defined primarily for the purpose of
   textual data, and is described in this section for that reason.
   However, it is conceivable that non-textual data might also wish to
   specify a charset value for some purpose, in which case the same
   syntax and values should be used.

   In general, composition software should always use the "lowest common
   denominator" character set possible.  For example, if a body contains
   only US-ASCII characters, it SHOULD be marked as being in the US-
   ASCII character set, not ISO-8859-1, which, like all the ISO-8859
   family of character sets, is a superset of US-ASCII.  More generally,
   if a widely-used character set is a subset of another character set,
   and a body contains only characters in the widely-used subset, it
   should be labelled as being in that subset.  This will increase the
   chances that the recipient will be able to view the resulting entity
   correctly.

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


4.1.3.  Plain Subtype

   The simplest and most important subtype of "text" is "plain".  This
   indicates plain text that does not contain any formatting commands or
   directives. Plain text is intended to be displayed "as-is", that is,
   no interpretation of embedded formatting commands, font attribute
   specifications, processing instructions, interpretation directives,
   or content markup should be necessary for proper display.  The
   default media type of "text/plain; charset=us-ascii" for Internet
   mail describes existing Internet practice.  That is, it is the type
   of body defined by RFC 822.

   No other "text" subtype is defined by this document.

4.1.4.  Unrecognized Subtypes

   Unrecognized subtypes of "text" should be treated as subtype "plain"
   as long as the MIME implementation knows how to handle the charset.
   Unrecognized subtypes which also specify an unrecognized charset
   should be treated as "application/octet- stream".

4.2.  Image Media Type

   A media type of "image" indicates that the body contains an image.
   The subtype names the specific image format.  These names are not
   case sensitive. An initial subtype is "jpeg" for the JPEG format
   using JFIF encoding [JPEG].

   The list of "image" subtypes given here is neither exclusive nor
   exhaustive, and is expected to grow as more types are registered with
   IANA, as described in RFC 2048.

   Unrecognized subtypes of "image" should at a miniumum be treated as
   "application/octet-stream".  Implementations may optionally elect to
   pass subtypes of "image" that they do not specifically recognize to a
   secure and robust general-purpose image viewing application, if such
   an application is available.

   NOTE: Using of a generic-purpose image viewing application this way
   inherits the security problems of the most dangerous type supported
   by the application.

4.3.  Audio Media Type

   A media type of "audio" indicates that the body contains audio data.
   Although there is not yet a consensus on an "ideal" audio format for
   use with computers, there is a pressing need for a format capable of
   providing interoperable behavior.



Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                    [Page 11]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


   The initial subtype of "basic" is specified to meet this requirement
   by providing an absolutely minimal lowest common denominator audio
   format.  It is expected that richer formats for higher quality and/or
   lower bandwidth audio will be defined by a later document.

   The content of the "audio/basic" subtype is single channel audio
   encoded using 8bit ISDN mu-law [PCM] at a sample rate of 8000 Hz.

   Unrecognized subtypes of "audio" should at a miniumum be treated as
   "application/octet-stream".  Implementations may optionally elect to
   pass subtypes of "audio" that they do not specifically recognize to a
   robust general-purpose audio playing application, if such an
   application is available.

4.4.  Video Media Type

   A media type of "video" indicates that the body contains a time-
   varying-picture image, possibly with color and coordinated sound.
   The term 'video' is used in its most generic sense, rather than with
   reference to any particular technology or format, and is not meant to
   preclude subtypes such as animated drawings encoded compactly.  The
   subtype "mpeg" refers to video coded according to the MPEG standard
   [MPEG].

   Note that although in general this document strongly discourages the
   mixing of multiple media in a single body, it is recognized that many
   so-called video formats include a representation for synchronized
   audio, and this is explicitly permitted for subtypes of "video".

   Unrecognized subtypes of "video" should at a minumum be treated as
   "application/octet-stream".  Implementations may optionally elect to
   pass subtypes of "video" that they do not specifically recognize to a
   robust general-purpose video display application, if such an
   application is available.

4.5.  Application Media Type

   The "application" media type is to be used for discrete data which do
   not fit in any of the other categories, and particularly for data to
   be processed by some type of application program.  This is
   information which must be processed by an application before it is
   viewable or usable by a user.  Expected uses for the "application"
   media type include file transfer, spreadsheets, data for mail-based
   scheduling systems, and languages for "active" (computational)
   material.  (The latter, in particular, can pose security problems
   which must be understood by implementors, and are considered in
   detail in the discussion of the "application/PostScript" media type.)




Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                    [Page 12]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


   For example, a meeting scheduler might define a standard
   representation for information about proposed meeting dates.  An
   intelligent user agent would use this information to conduct a dialog
   with the user, and might then send additional material based on that
   dialog.  More generally, there have been several "active" messaging
   languages developed in which programs in a suitably specialized
   language are transported to a remote location and automatically run
   in the recipient's environment.

   Such applications may be defined as subtypes of the "application"
   media type. This document defines two subtypes:

   octet-stream, and PostScript.

   The subtype of "application" will often be either the name or include
   part of the name of the application for which the data are intended.
   This does not mean, however, that any application program name may be
   used freely as a subtype of "application".

4.5.1.  Octet-Stream Subtype

   The "octet-stream" subtype is used to indicate that a body contains
   arbitrary binary data.  The set of currently defined parameters is:

    (1)   TYPE -- the general type or category of binary data.
          This is intended as information for the human recipient
          rather than for any automatic processing.

    (2)   PADDING -- the number of bits of padding that were
          appended to the bit-stream comprising the actual
          contents to produce the enclosed 8bit byte-oriented
          data.  This is useful for enclosing a bit-stream in a
          body when the total number of bits is not a multiple of
          8.

   Both of these parameters are optional.

   An additional parameter, "CONVERSIONS", was defined in RFC 1341 but
   has since been removed.  RFC 1341 also defined the use of a "NAME"
   parameter which gave a suggested file name to be used if the data
   were to be written to a file.  This has been deprecated in
   anticipation of a separate Content-Disposition header field, to be
   defined in a subsequent RFC.

   The recommended action for an implementation that receives an
   "application/octet-stream" entity is to simply offer to put the data
   in a file, with any Content-Transfer-Encoding undone, or perhaps to
   use it as input to a user-specified process.



Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                    [Page 13]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


   To reduce the danger of transmitting rogue programs, it is strongly
   recommended that implementations NOT implement a path-search
   mechanism whereby an arbitrary program named in the Content-Type
   parameter (e.g., an "interpreter=" parameter) is found and executed
   using the message body as input.

4.5.2.  PostScript Subtype

   A media type of "application/postscript" indicates a PostScript
   program.  Currently two variants of the PostScript language are
   allowed; the original level 1 variant is described in [POSTSCRIPT]
   and the more recent level 2 variant is described in [POSTSCRIPT2].

   PostScript is a registered trademark of Adobe Systems, Inc.  Use of
   the MIME media type "application/postscript" implies recognition of
   that trademark and all the rights it entails.

   The PostScript language definition provides facilities for internal
   labelling of the specific language features a given program uses.
   This labelling, called the PostScript document structuring
   conventions, or DSC, is very general and provides substantially more
   information than just the language level.  The use of document
   structuring conventions, while not required, is strongly recommended
   as an aid to interoperability.  Documents which lack proper
   structuring conventions cannot be tested to see whether or not they
   will work in a given environment.  As such, some systems may assume
   the worst and refuse to process unstructured documents.

   The execution of general-purpose PostScript interpreters entails
   serious security risks, and implementors are discouraged from simply
   sending PostScript bodies to "off- the-shelf" interpreters.  While it
   is usually safe to send PostScript to a printer, where the potential
   for harm is greatly constrained by typical printer environments,
   implementors should consider all of the following before they add
   interactive display of PostScript bodies to their MIME readers.

   The remainder of this section outlines some, though probably not all,
   of the possible problems with the transport of PostScript entities.

    (1)   Dangerous operations in the PostScript language
          include, but may not be limited to, the PostScript
          operators "deletefile", "renamefile", "filenameforall",
          and "file".  "File" is only dangerous when applied to
          something other than standard input or output.
          Implementations may also define additional nonstandard
          file operators; these may also pose a threat to
          security. "Filenameforall", the wildcard file search
          operator, may appear at first glance to be harmless.



Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                    [Page 14]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


          Note, however, that this operator has the potential to
          reveal information about what files the recipient has
          access to, and this information may itself be
          sensitive.  Message senders should avoid the use of
          potentially dangerous file operators, since these
          operators are quite likely to be unavailable in secure
          PostScript implementations.  Message receiving and
          displaying software should either completely disable
          all potentially dangerous file operators or take
          special care not to delegate any special authority to
          their operation.  These operators should be viewed as
          being done by an outside agency when interpreting
          PostScript documents.  Such disabling and/or checking
          should be done completely outside of the reach of the
          PostScript language itself; care should be taken to
          insure that no method exists for re-enabling full-
          function versions of these operators.

    (2)   The PostScript language provides facilities for exiting
          the normal interpreter, or server, loop.  Changes made
          in this "outer" environment are customarily retained
          across documents, and may in some cases be retained
          semipermanently in nonvolatile memory.  The operators
          associated with exiting the interpreter loop have the
          potential to interfere with subsequent document
          processing.  As such, their unrestrained use
          constitutes a threat of service denial.  PostScript
          operators that exit the interpreter loop include, but
          may not be limited to, the exitserver and startjob
          operators.  Message sending software should not
          generate PostScript that depends on exiting the
          interpreter loop to operate, since the ability to exit
          will probably be unavailable in secure PostScript
          implementations.  Message receiving and displaying
          software should completely disable the ability to make
          retained changes to the PostScript environment by
          eliminating or disabling the "startjob" and
          "exitserver" operations.  If these operations cannot be
          eliminated or completely disabled the password
          associated with them should at least be set to a hard-
          to-guess value.

    (3)   PostScript provides operators for setting system-wide
          and device-specific parameters.  These parameter
          settings may be retained across jobs and may
          potentially pose a threat to the correct operation of
          the interpreter.  The PostScript operators that set
          system and device parameters include, but may not be



Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                    [Page 15]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


          limited to, the "setsystemparams" and "setdevparams"
          operators.  Message sending software should not
          generate PostScript that depends on the setting of
          system or device parameters to operate correctly.  The
          ability to set these parameters will probably be
          unavailable in secure PostScript implementations.
          Message receiving and displaying software should
          disable the ability to change system and device
          parameters.  If these operators cannot be completely
          disabled the password associated with them should at
          least be set to a hard-to-guess value.

    (4)   Some PostScript implementations provide nonstandard
          facilities for the direct loading and execution of
          machine code.  Such facilities are quite obviously open
          to substantial abuse.  Message sending software should
          not make use of such features.  Besides being totally
          hardware-specific, they are also likely to be
          unavailable in secure implementations of PostScript.
          Message receiving and displaying software should not
          allow such operators to be used if they exist.

    (5)   PostScript is an extensible language, and many, if not
          most, implementations of it provide a number of their
          own extensions.  This document does not deal with such
          extensions explicitly since they constitute an unknown
          factor.  Message sending software should not make use
          of nonstandard extensions; they are likely to be
          missing from some implementations.  Message receiving
          and displaying software should make sure that any
          nonstandard PostScript operators are secure and don't
          present any kind of threat.

    (6)   It is possible to write PostScript that consumes huge
          amounts of various system resources.  It is also
          possible to write PostScript programs that loop
          indefinitely.  Both types of programs have the
          potential to cause damage if sent to unsuspecting
          recipients.  Message-sending software should avoid the
          construction and dissemination of such programs, which
          is antisocial.  Message receiving and displaying
          software should provide appropriate mechanisms to abort
          processing after a reasonable amount of time has
          elapsed. In addition, PostScript interpreters should be
          limited to the consumption of only a reasonable amount
          of any given system resource.





Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                    [Page 16]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


    (7)   It is possible to include raw binary information inside
          PostScript in various forms.  This is not recommended
          for use in Internet mail, both because it is not
          supported by all PostScript interpreters and because it
          significantly complicates the use of a MIME Content-
          Transfer-Encoding.  (Without such binary, PostScript
          may typically be viewed as line-oriented data.  The
          treatment of CRLF sequences becomes extremely
          problematic if binary and line-oriented data are mixed
          in a single Postscript data stream.)

    (8)   Finally, bugs may exist in some PostScript interpreters
          which could possibly be exploited to gain unauthorized
          access to a recipient's system.  Apart from noting this
          possibility, there is no specific action to take to
          prevent this, apart from the timely correction of such
          bugs if any are found.

4.5.3.  Other Application Subtypes

   It is expected that many other subtypes of "application" will be
   defined in the future.  MIME implementations must at a minimum treat
   any unrecognized subtypes as being equivalent to "application/octet-
   stream".

5.  Composite Media Type Values

   The remaining two of the seven initial Content-Type values refer to
   composite entities.  Composite entities are handled using MIME
   mechanisms -- a MIME processor typically handles the body directly.

5.1.  Multipart Media Type

   In the case of multipart entities, in which one or more different
   sets of data are combined in a single body, a "multipart" media type
   field must appear in the entity's header.  The body must then contain
   one or more body parts, each preceded by a boundary delimiter line,
   and the last one followed by a closing boundary delimiter line.
   After its boundary delimiter line, each body part then consists of a
   header area, a blank line, and a body area.  Thus a body part is
   similar to an RFC 822 message in syntax, but different in meaning.

   A body part is an entity and hence is NOT to be interpreted as
   actually being an RFC 822 message.  To begin with, NO header fields
   are actually required in body parts.  A body part that starts with a
   blank line, therefore, is allowed and is a body part for which all
   default values are to be assumed.  In such a case, the absence of a
   Content-Type header usually indicates that the corresponding body has



Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                    [Page 17]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


   a content-type of "text/plain; charset=US-ASCII".

   The only header fields that have defined meaning for body parts are
   those the names of which begin with "Content-".  All other header
   fields may be ignored in body parts.  Although they should generally
   be retained if at all possible, they may be discarded by gateways if
   necessary.  Such other fields are permitted to appear in body parts
   but must not be depended on.  "X-" fields may be created for
   experimental or private purposes, with the recognition that the
   information they contain may be lost at some gateways.

   NOTE:  The distinction between an RFC 822 message and a body part is
   subtle, but important.  A gateway between Internet and X.400 mail,
   for example, must be able to tell the difference between a body part
   that contains an image and a body part that contains an encapsulated
   message, the body of which is a JPEG image.  In order to represent
   the latter, the body part must have "Content-Type: message/rfc822",
   and its body (after the blank line) must be the encapsulated message,
   with its own "Content-Type: image/jpeg" header field.  The use of
   similar syntax facilitates the conversion of messages to body parts,
   and vice versa, but the distinction between the two must be
   understood by implementors.  (For the special case in which parts
   actually are messages, a "digest" subtype is also defined.)

   As stated previously, each body part is preceded by a boundary
   delimiter line that contains the boundary delimiter.  The boundary
   delimiter MUST NOT appear inside any of the encapsulated parts, on a
   line by itself or as the prefix of any line.  This implies that it is
   crucial that the composing agent be able to choose and specify a
   unique boundary parameter value that does not contain the boundary
   parameter value of an enclosing multipart as a prefix.

   All present and future subtypes of the "multipart" type must use an
   identical syntax.  Subtypes may differ in their semantics, and may
   impose additional restrictions on syntax, but must conform to the
   required syntax for the "multipart" type.  This requirement ensures
   that all conformant user agents will at least be able to recognize
   and separate the parts of any multipart entity, even those of an
   unrecognized subtype.

   As stated in the definition of the Content-Transfer-Encoding field
   [RFC 2045], no encoding other than "7bit", "8bit", or "binary" is
   permitted for entities of type "multipart".  The "multipart" boundary
   delimiters and header fields are always represented as 7bit US-ASCII
   in any case (though the header fields may encode non-US-ASCII header
   text as per RFC 2047) and data within the body parts can be encoded
   on a part-by-part basis, with Content-Transfer-Encoding fields for
   each appropriate body part.



Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                    [Page 18]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


5.1.1.  Common Syntax

   This section defines a common syntax for subtypes of "multipart".
   All subtypes of "multipart" must use this syntax.  A simple example
   of a multipart message also appears in this section.  An example of a
   more complex multipart message is given in RFC 2049.

   The Content-Type field for multipart entities requires one parameter,
   "boundary". The boundary delimiter line is then defined as a line
   consisting entirely of two hyphen characters ("-", decimal value 45)
   followed by the boundary parameter value from the Content-Type header
   field, optional linear whitespace, and a terminating CRLF.

   NOTE:  The hyphens are for rough compatibility with the earlier RFC
   934 method of message encapsulation, and for ease of searching for
   the boundaries in some implementations.  However, it should be noted
   that multipart messages are NOT completely compatible with RFC 934
   encapsulations; in particular, they do not obey RFC 934 quoting
   conventions for embedded lines that begin with hyphens.  This
   mechanism was chosen over the RFC 934 mechanism because the latter
   causes lines to grow with each level of quoting.  The combination of
   this growth with the fact that SMTP implementations sometimes wrap
   long lines made the RFC 934 mechanism unsuitable for use in the event
   that deeply-nested multipart structuring is ever desired.

   WARNING TO IMPLEMENTORS:  The grammar for parameters on the Content-
   type field is such that it is often necessary to enclose the boundary
   parameter values in quotes on the Content-type line.  This is not
   always necessary, but never hurts. Implementors should be sure to
   study the grammar carefully in order to avoid producing invalid
   Content-type fields.  Thus, a typical "multipart" Content-Type header
   field might look like this:

     Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=gc0p4Jq0M2Yt08j34c0p

   But the following is not valid:

     Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=gc0pJq0M:08jU534c0p

   (because of the colon) and must instead be represented as

     Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary="gc0pJq0M:08jU534c0p"

   This Content-Type value indicates that the content consists of one or
   more parts, each with a structure that is syntactically identical to
   an RFC 822 message, except that the header area is allowed to be
   completely empty, and that the parts are each preceded by the line




Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                    [Page 19]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


     --gc0pJq0M:08jU534c0p

   The boundary delimiter MUST occur at the beginning of a line, i.e.,
   following a CRLF, and the initial CRLF is considered to be attached
   to the boundary delimiter line rather than part of the preceding
   part.  The boundary may be followed by zero or more characters of
   linear whitespace. It is then terminated by either another CRLF and
   the header fields for the next part, or by two CRLFs, in which case
   there are no header fields for the next part.  If no Content-Type
   field is present it is assumed to be "message/rfc822" in a
   "multipart/digest" and "text/plain" otherwise.

   NOTE:  The CRLF preceding the boundary delimiter line is conceptually
   attached to the boundary so that it is possible to have a part that
   does not end with a CRLF (line  break).  Body parts that must be
   considered to end with line breaks, therefore, must have two CRLFs
   preceding the boundary delimiter line, the first of which is part of
   the preceding body part, and the second of which is part of the
   encapsulation boundary.

   Boundary delimiters must not appear within the encapsulated material,
   and must be no longer than 70 characters, not counting the two
   leading hyphens.

   The boundary delimiter line following the last body part is a
   distinguished delimiter that indicates that no further body parts
   will follow.  Such a delimiter line is identical to the previous
   delimiter lines, with the addition of two more hyphens after the
   boundary parameter value.

     --gc0pJq0M:08jU534c0p--

   NOTE TO IMPLEMENTORS:  Boundary string comparisons must compare the
   boundary value with the beginning of each candidate line.  An exact
   match of the entire candidate line is not required; it is sufficient
   that the boundary appear in its entirety following the CRLF.

   There appears to be room for additional information prior to the
   first boundary delimiter line and following the final boundary
   delimiter line.  These areas should generally be left blank, and
   implementations must ignore anything that appears before the first
   boundary delimiter line or after the last one.

   NOTE:  These "preamble" and "epilogue" areas are generally not used
   because of the lack of proper typing of these parts and the lack of
   clear semantics for handling these areas at gateways, particularly
   X.400 gateways.  However, rather than leaving the preamble area
   blank, many MIME implementations have found this to be a convenient



Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                    [Page 20]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


   place to insert an explanatory note for recipients who read the
   message with pre-MIME software, since such notes will be ignored by
   MIME-compliant software.

   NOTE:  Because boundary delimiters must not appear in the body parts
   being encapsulated, a user agent must exercise care to choose a
   unique boundary parameter value.  The boundary parameter value in the
   example above could have been the result of an algorithm designed to
   produce boundary delimiters with a very low probability of already
   existing in the data to be encapsulated without having to prescan the
   data.  Alternate algorithms might result in more "readable" boundary
   delimiters for a recipient with an old user agent, but would require
   more attention to the possibility that the boundary delimiter might
   appear at the beginning of some line in the encapsulated part.  The
   simplest boundary delimiter line possible is something like "---",
   with a closing boundary delimiter line of "-----".

   As a very simple example, the following multipart message has two
   parts, both of them plain text, one of them explicitly typed and one
   of them implicitly typed:

     From: Nathaniel Borenstein <nsb@bellcore.com>
     To: Ned Freed <ned@innosoft.com>
     Date: Sun, 21 Mar 1993 23:56:48 -0800 (PST)
     Subject: Sample message
     MIME-Version: 1.0
     Content-type: multipart/mixed; boundary="simple boundary"

     This is the preamble.  It is to be ignored, though it
     is a handy place for composition agents to include an
     explanatory note to non-MIME conformant readers.

     --simple boundary

     This is implicitly typed plain US-ASCII text.
     It does NOT end with a linebreak.
     --simple boundary
     Content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

     This is explicitly typed plain US-ASCII text.
     It DOES end with a linebreak.

     --simple boundary--

     This is the epilogue.  It is also to be ignored.






Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                    [Page 21]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


   The use of a media type of "multipart" in a body part within another
   "multipart" entity is explicitly allowed.  In such cases, for obvious
   reasons, care must be taken to ensure that each nested "multipart"
   entity uses a different boundary delimiter.  See RFC 2049 for an
   example of nested "multipart" entities.

   The use of the "multipart" media type with only a single body part
   may be useful in certain contexts, and is explicitly permitted.

   NOTE: Experience has shown that a "multipart" media type with a
   single body part is useful for sending non-text media types.  It has
   the advantage of providing the preamble as a place to include
   decoding instructions.  In addition, a number of SMTP gateways move
   or remove the MIME headers, and a clever MIME decoder can take a good
   guess at multipart boundaries even in the absence of the Content-Type
   header and thereby successfully decode the message.

   The only mandatory global parameter for the "multipart" media type is
   the boundary parameter, which consists of 1 to 70 characters from a
   set of characters known to be very robust through mail gateways, and
   NOT ending with white space. (If a boundary delimiter line appears to
   end with white space, the white space must be presumed to have been
   added by a gateway, and must be deleted.)  It is formally specified
   by the following BNF:

     boundary := 0*69<bchars> bcharsnospace

     bchars := bcharsnospace / " "

     bcharsnospace := DIGIT / ALPHA / "'" / "(" / ")" /
                      "+" / "_" / "," / "-" / "." /
                      "/" / ":" / "=" / "?"

   Overall, the body of a "multipart" entity may be specified as
   follows:

     dash-boundary := "--" boundary
                      ; boundary taken from the value of
                      ; boundary parameter of the
                      ; Content-Type field.

     multipart-body := [preamble CRLF]
                       dash-boundary transport-padding CRLF
                       body-part *encapsulation

                       [CRLF epilogue]

   IMPORTANT:  The free insertion of linear-white-space and RFC 822
   comments between the elements shown in this BNF is NOT allowed since
   this BNF does not specify a structured header field.

   NOTE:  In certain transport enclaves, RFC 822 restrictions such as
   the one that limits bodies to printable US-ASCII characters may not
   be in force. (That is, the transport domains may exist that resemble
   standard Internet mail transport as specified in RFC 821 and assumed
   by RFC 822, but without certain restrictions.) The relaxation of
   these restrictions should be construed as locally extending the
   definition of bodies, for example to include octets outside of the
   US-ASCII range, as long as these extensions are supported by the
   transport and adequately documented in the Content- Transfer-Encoding
   header field.  However, in no event are headers (either message
   headers or body part headers) allowed to contain anything other than
   US-ASCII characters.



Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                    [Page 23]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


   NOTE:  Conspicuously missing from the "multipart" type is a notion of
   structured, related body parts. It is recommended that those wishing
   to provide more structured or integrated multipart messaging
   facilities should define subtypes of multipart that are syntactically
   identical but define relationships between the various parts. For
   example, subtypes of multipart could be defined that include a
   distinguished part which in turn is used to specify the relationships
   between the other parts, probably referring to them by their
   Content-ID field.  Old implementations will not recognize the new
   subtype if this approach is used, but will treat it as
   multipart/mixed and will thus be able to show the user the parts that
   are recognized.

5.1.2.  Handling Nested Messages and Multiparts

   The "message/rfc822" subtype defined in a subsequent section of this
   document has no terminating condition other than running out of data.
   Similarly, an improperly truncated "multipart" entity may not have
   any terminating boundary marker, and can turn up operationally due to
   mail system malfunctions.

   It is essential that such entities be handled correctly when they are
   themselves imbedded inside of another "multipart" structure.  MIME
   implementations are therefore required to recognize outer level
   boundary markers at ANY level of inner nesting.  It is not sufficient
   to only check for the next expected marker or other terminating
   condition.

5.1.3.  Mixed Subtype

   The "mixed" subtype of "multipart" is intended for use when the body
   parts are independent and need to be bundled in a particular order.
   Any "multipart" subtypes that an implementation does not recognize
   must be treated as being of subtype "mixed".

5.1.4.  Alternative Subtype

   The "multipart/alternative" type is syntactically identical to
   "multipart/mixed", but the semantics are different.  In particular,
   each of the body parts is an "alternative" version of the same
   information.

   Systems should recognize that the content of the various parts are
   interchangeable.  Systems should choose the "best" type based on the
   local environment and references, in some cases even through user
   interaction.  As with "multipart/mixed", the order of body parts is
   significant.  In this case, the alternatives appear in an order of
   increasing faithfulness to the original content.  In general, the



Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                    [Page 24]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


   best choice is the LAST part of a type supported by the recipient
   system's local environment.

   "Multipart/alternative" may be used, for example, to send a message
   in a fancy text format in such a way that it can easily be displayed
   anywhere:

     From: Nathaniel Borenstein <nsb@bellcore.com>
     To: Ned Freed <ned@innosoft.com>
     Date: Mon, 22 Mar 1993 09:41:09 -0800 (PST)
     Subject: Formatted text mail
     MIME-Version: 1.0
     Content-Type: multipart/alternative; boundary=boundary42

     --boundary42
     Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

       ... plain text version of message goes here ...

     --boundary42
     Content-Type: text/enriched

       ... RFC 1896 text/enriched version of same message
           goes here ...

     --boundary42
     Content-Type: application/x-whatever

       ... fanciest version of same message goes here ...

     --boundary42--

   In this example, users whose mail systems understood the
   "application/x-whatever" format would see only the fancy version,
   while other users would see only the enriched or plain text version,
   depending on the capabilities of their system.

   In general, user agents that compose "multipart/alternative" entities
   must place the body parts in increasing order of preference, that is,
   with the preferred format last.  For fancy text, the sending user
   agent should put the plainest format first and the richest format
   last.  Receiving user agents should pick and display the last format
   they are capable of displaying.  In the case where one of the
   alternatives is itself of type "multipart" and contains unrecognized
   sub-parts, the user agent may choose either to show that alternative,
   an earlier alternative, or both.





Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                    [Page 25]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


   NOTE: From an implementor's perspective, it might seem more sensible
   to reverse this ordering, and have the plainest alternative last.
   However, placing the plainest alternative first is the friendliest
   possible option when "multipart/alternative" entities are viewed
   using a non-MIME-conformant viewer.  While this approach does impose
   some burden on conformant MIME viewers, interoperability with older
   mail readers was deemed to be more important in this case.

   It may be the case that some user agents, if they can recognize more
   than one of the formats, will prefer to offer the user the choice of
   which format to view.  This makes sense, for example, if a message
   includes both a nicely- formatted image version and an easily-edited
   text version.  What is most critical, however, is that the user not
   automatically be shown multiple versions of the same data.  Either
   the user should be shown the last recognized version or should be
   given the choice.

   THE SEMANTICS OF CONTENT-ID IN MULTIPART/ALTERNATIVE:  Each part of a
   "multipart/alternative" entity represents the same data, but the
   mappings between the two are not necessarily without information
   loss.  For example, information is lost when translating ODA to
   PostScript or plain text.  It is recommended that each part should
   have a different Content-ID value in the case where the information
   content of the two parts is not identical.  And when the information
   content is identical -- for example, where several parts of type
   "message/external-body" specify alternate ways to access the
   identical data -- the same Content-ID field value should be used, to
   optimize any caching mechanisms that might be present on the
   recipient's end.  However, the Content-ID values used by the parts
   should NOT be the same Content-ID value that describes the
   "multipart/alternative" as a whole, if there is any such Content-ID
   field.  That is, one Content-ID value will refer to the
   "multipart/alternative" entity, while one or more other Content-ID
   values will refer to the parts inside it.

5.1.5.  Digest Subtype

   This document defines a "digest" subtype of the "multipart" Content-
   Type.  This type is syntactically identical to "multipart/mixed", but
   the semantics are different.  In particular, in a digest, the default
   Content-Type value for a body part is changed from "text/plain" to
   "message/rfc822".  This is done to allow a more readable digest
   format that is largely compatible (except for the quoting convention)
   with RFC 934.

   Note: Though it is possible to specify a Content-Type value for a
   body part in a digest which is other than "message/rfc822", such as a
   "text/plain" part containing a description of the material in the



Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                    [Page 26]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


   digest, actually doing so is undesireble. The "multipart/digest"
   Content-Type is intended to be used to send collections of messages.
   If a "text/plain" part is needed, it should be included as a seperate
   part of a "multipart/mixed" message.

   A digest in this format might, then, look something like this:

     From: Moderator-Address
     To: Recipient-List
     Date: Mon, 22 Mar 1994 13:34:51 +0000
     Subject: Internet Digest, volume 42
     MIME-Version: 1.0
     Content-Type: multipart/mixed;
                   boundary="---- main boundary ----"

     ------ main boundary ----

       ...Introductory text or table of contents...

     ------ main boundary ----
     Content-Type: multipart/digest;
                   boundary="---- next message ----"

     ------ next message ----

     From: someone-else
     Date: Fri, 26 Mar 1993 11:13:32 +0200
     Subject: my opinion

       ...body goes here ...

     ------ next message ----

     From: someone-else-again
     Date: Fri, 26 Mar 1993 10:07:13 -0500
     Subject: my different opinion

       ... another body goes here ...

     ------ next message ------

     ------ main boundary ------

5.1.6.  Parallel Subtype

   This document defines a "parallel" subtype of the "multipart"
   Content-Type.  This type is syntactically identical to
   "multipart/mixed", but the semantics are different.  In particular,



Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                    [Page 27]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


   in a parallel entity, the order of body parts is not significant.

   A common presentation of this type is to display all of the parts
   simultaneously on hardware and software that are capable of doing so.
   However, composing agents should be aware that many mail readers will
   lack this capability and will show the parts serially in any event.

5.1.7.  Other Multipart Subtypes

   Other "multipart" subtypes are expected in the future.  MIME
   implementations must in general treat unrecognized subtypes of
   "multipart" as being equivalent to "multipart/mixed".

5.2.  Message Media Type

   It is frequently desirable, in sending mail, to encapsulate another
   mail message.  A special media type, "message", is defined to
   facilitate this.  In particular, the "rfc822" subtype of "message" is
   used to encapsulate RFC 822 messages.

   NOTE:  It has been suggested that subtypes of "message" might be
   defined for forwarded or rejected messages.  However, forwarded and
   rejected messages can be handled as multipart messages in which the
   first part contains any control or descriptive information, and a
   second part, of type "message/rfc822", is the forwarded or rejected
   message.  Composing rejection and forwarding messages in this manner
   will preserve the type information on the original message and allow
   it to be correctly presented to the recipient, and hence is strongly
   encouraged.

   Subtypes of "message" often impose restrictions on what encodings are
   allowed.  These restrictions are described in conjunction with each
   specific subtype.

   Mail gateways, relays, and other mail handling agents are commonly
   known to alter the top-level header of an RFC 822 message.  In
   particular, they frequently add, remove, or reorder header fields.
   These operations are explicitly forbidden for the encapsulated
   headers embedded in the bodies of messages of type "message."

5.2.1.  RFC822 Subtype

   A media type of "message/rfc822" indicates that the body contains an
   encapsulated message, with the syntax of an RFC 822 message.
   However, unlike top-level RFC 822 messages, the restriction that each
   "message/rfc822" body must include a "From", "Date", and at least one
   destination header is removed and replaced with the requirement that
   at least one of "From", "Subject", or "Date" must be present.



Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                    [Page 28]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


   It should be noted that, despite the use of the numbers "822", a
   "message/rfc822" entity isn't restricted to material in strict
   conformance to RFC822, nor are the semantics of "message/rfc822"
   objects restricted to the semantics defined in RFC822. More
   specifically, a "message/rfc822" message could well be a News article
   or a MIME message.

   No encoding other than "7bit", "8bit", or "binary" is permitted for
   the body of a "message/rfc822" entity.  The message header fields are
   always US-ASCII in any case, and data within the body can still be
   encoded, in which case the Content-Transfer-Encoding header field in
   the encapsulated message will reflect this.  Non-US-ASCII text in the
   headers of an encapsulated message can be specified using the
   mechanisms described in RFC 2047.

5.2.2.  Partial Subtype

   The "partial" subtype is defined to allow large entities to be
   delivered as several separate pieces of mail and automatically
   reassembled by a receiving user agent.  (The concept is similar to IP
   fragmentation and reassembly in the basic Internet Protocols.)  This
   mechanism can be used when intermediate transport agents limit the
   size of individual messages that can be sent.  The media type
   "message/partial" thus indicates that the body contains a fragment of
   a larger entity.

   Because data of type "message" may never be encoded in base64 or
   quoted-printable, a problem might arise if "message/partial" entities
   are constructed in an environment that supports binary or 8bit
   transport.  The problem is that the binary data would be split into
   multiple "message/partial" messages, each of them requiring binary
   transport.  If such messages were encountered at a gateway into a
   7bit transport environment, there would be no way to properly encode
   them for the 7bit world, aside from waiting for all of the fragments,
   reassembling the inner message, and then encoding the reassembled
   data in base64 or quoted-printable.  Since it is possible that
   different fragments might go through different gateways, even this is
   not an acceptable solution.  For this reason, it is specified that
   entities of type "message/partial" must always have a content-
   transfer-encoding of 7bit (the default).  In particular, even in
   environments that support binary or 8bit transport, the use of a
   content- transfer-encoding of "8bit" or "binary" is explicitly
   prohibited for MIME entities of type "message/partial". This in turn
   implies that the inner message must not use "8bit" or "binary"
   encoding.






Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                    [Page 29]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


   Because some message transfer agents may choose to automatically
   fragment large messages, and because such agents may use very
   different fragmentation thresholds, it is possible that the pieces of
   a partial message, upon reassembly, may prove themselves to comprise
   a partial message.  This is explicitly permitted.

   Three parameters must be specified in the Content-Type field of type
   "message/partial":  The first, "id", is a unique identifier, as close
   to a world-unique identifier as possible, to be used to match the
   fragments together. (In general, the identifier is essentially a
   message-id; if placed in double quotes, it can be ANY message-id, in
   accordance with the BNF for "parameter" given in RFC 2045.)  The
   second, "number", an integer, is the fragment number, which indicates
   where this fragment fits into the sequence of fragments.  The third,
   "total", another integer, is the total number of fragments.  This
   third subfield is required on the final fragment, and is optional
   (though encouraged) on the earlier fragments.  Note also that these
   parameters may be given in any order.

   Thus, the second piece of a 3-piece message may have either of the
   following header fields:

     Content-Type: Message/Partial; number=2; total=3;
                   id="oc=jpbe0M2Yt4s@thumper.bellcore.com"

     Content-Type: Message/Partial;
                   id="oc=jpbe0M2Yt4s@thumper.bellcore.com";
                   number=2

   But the third piece MUST specify the total number of fragments:

     Content-Type: Message/Partial; number=3; total=3;
                   id="oc=jpbe0M2Yt4s@thumper.bellcore.com"

   Note that fragment numbering begins with 1, not 0.

   When the fragments of an entity broken up in this manner are put
   together, the result is always a complete MIME entity, which may have
   its own Content-Type header field, and thus may contain any other
   data type.

5.2.2.1.  Message Fragmentation and Reassembly

   The semantics of a reassembled partial message must be those of the
   "inner" message, rather than of a message containing the inner
   message.  This makes it possible, for example, to send a large audio
   message as several partial messages, and still have it appear to the
   recipient as a simple audio message rather than as an encapsulated



Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                    [Page 30]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


   message containing an audio message.  That is, the encapsulation of
   the message is considered to be "transparent".

   When generating and reassembling the pieces of a "message/partial"
   message, the headers of the encapsulated message must be merged with
   the headers of the enclosing entities.  In this process the following
   rules must be observed:

    (1)   Fragmentation agents must split messages at line
          boundaries only. This restriction is imposed because
          splits at points other than the ends of lines in turn
          depends on message transports being able to preserve
          the semantics of messages that don't end with a CRLF
          sequence. Many transports are incapable of preserving
          such semantics.

    (2)   All of the header fields from the initial enclosing
          message, except those that start with "Content-" and
          the specific header fields "Subject", "Message-ID",
          "Encrypted", and "MIME-Version", must be copied, in
          order, to the new message.

    (3)   The header fields in the enclosed message which start
          with "Content-", plus the "Subject", "Message-ID",
          "Encrypted", and "MIME-Version" fields, must be
          appended, in order, to the header fields of the new
          message.  Any header fields in the enclosed message
          which do not start with "Content-" (except for the
          "Subject", "Message-ID", "Encrypted", and "MIME-
          Version" fields) will be ignored and dropped.

    (4)   All of the header fields from the second and any
          subsequent enclosing messages are discarded by the
          reassembly process.

5.2.2.2.  Fragmentation and Reassembly Example

   If an audio message is broken into two pieces, the first piece might
   look something like this:

     X-Weird-Header-1: Foo
     From: Bill@host.com
     To: joe@otherhost.com
     Date: Fri, 26 Mar 1993 12:59:38 -0500 (EST)
     Subject: Audio mail (part 1 of 2)
     Message-ID: <id1@host.com>
     MIME-Version: 1.0
     Content-type: message/partial; id="ABC@host.com";



Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                    [Page 31]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


                   number=1; total=2

     X-Weird-Header-1: Bar
     X-Weird-Header-2: Hello
     Message-ID: <anotherid@foo.com>
     Subject: Audio mail
     MIME-Version: 1.0
     Content-type: audio/basic
     Content-transfer-encoding: base64

       ... first half of encoded audio data goes here ...

   and the second half might look something like this:

     From: Bill@host.com
     To: joe@otherhost.com
     Date: Fri, 26 Mar 1993 12:59:38 -0500 (EST)
     Subject: Audio mail (part 2 of 2)
     MIME-Version: 1.0
     Message-ID: <id2@host.com>
     Content-type: message/partial;
                   id="ABC@host.com"; number=2; total=2

       ... second half of encoded audio data goes here ...

   Then, when the fragmented message is reassembled, the resulting
   message to be displayed to the user should look something like this:

     X-Weird-Header-1: Foo
     From: Bill@host.com
     To: joe@otherhost.com
     Date: Fri, 26 Mar 1993 12:59:38 -0500 (EST)
     Subject: Audio mail
     Message-ID: <anotherid@foo.com>
     MIME-Version: 1.0
     Content-type: audio/basic
     Content-transfer-encoding: base64

       ... first half of encoded audio data goes here ...
       ... second half of encoded audio data goes here ...

   The inclusion of a "References" field in the headers of the second
   and subsequent pieces of a fragmented message that references the
   Message-Id on the previous piece may be of benefit to mail readers
   that understand and track references.  However, the generation of
   such "References" fields is entirely optional.





Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                    [Page 32]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


   Finally, it should be noted that the "Encrypted" header field has
   been made obsolete by Privacy Enhanced Messaging (PEM) [RFC-1421,
   RFC-1422, RFC-1423, RFC-1424], but the rules above are nevertheless
   believed to describe the correct way to treat it if it is encountered
   in the context of conversion to and from "message/partial" fragments.

5.2.3.  External-Body Subtype

   The external-body subtype indicates that the actual body data are not
   included, but merely referenced.  In this case, the parameters
   describe a mechanism for accessing the external data.

   When a MIME entity is of type "message/external-body", it consists of
   a header, two consecutive CRLFs, and the message header for the
   encapsulated message.  If another pair of consecutive CRLFs appears,
   this of course ends the message header for the encapsulated message.
   However, since the encapsulated message's body is itself external, it
   does NOT appear in the area that follows.  For example, consider the
   following message:

     Content-type: message/external-body;
                   access-type=local-file;
                   name="/u/nsb/Me.jpeg"

     Content-type: image/jpeg
     Content-ID: <id42@guppylake.bellcore.com>
     Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary

     THIS IS NOT REALLY THE BODY!

   The area at the end, which might be called the "phantom body", is
   ignored for most external-body messages.  However, it may be used to
   contain auxiliary information for some such messages, as indeed it is
   when the access-type is "mail- server".  The only access-type defined
   in this document that uses the phantom body is "mail-server", but
   other access-types may be defined in the future in other
   specifications that use this area.

   The encapsulated headers in ALL "message/external-body" entities MUST
   include a Content-ID header field to give a unique identifier by
   which to reference the data.  This identifier may be used for caching
   mechanisms, and for recognizing the receipt of the data when the
   access-type is "mail-server".

   Note that, as specified here, the tokens that describe external-body
   data, such as file names and mail server commands, are required to be
   in the US-ASCII character set.




Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                    [Page 33]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


   If this proves problematic in practice, a new mechanism may be
   required as a future extension to MIME, either as newly defined
   access-types for "message/external-body" or by some other mechanism.

   As with "message/partial", MIME entities of type "message/external-
   body" MUST have a content-transfer-encoding of 7bit (the default).
   In particular, even in environments that support binary or 8bit
   transport, the use of a content- transfer-encoding of "8bit" or
   "binary" is explicitly prohibited for entities of type
   "message/external-body".

5.2.3.1.  General External-Body Parameters

   The parameters that may be used with any "message/external- body"
   are:

    (1)   ACCESS-TYPE -- A word indicating the supported access
          mechanism by which the file or data may be obtained.
          This word is not case sensitive.  Values include, but
          are not limited to, "FTP", "ANON-FTP", "TFTP", "LOCAL-
          FILE", and "MAIL-SERVER".  Future values, except for
          experimental values beginning with "X-", must be
          registered with IANA, as described in RFC 2048.
          This parameter is unconditionally mandatory and MUST be
          present on EVERY "message/external-body".

    (2)   EXPIRATION -- The date (in the RFC 822 "date-time"
          syntax, as extended by RFC 1123 to permit 4 digits in
          the year field) after which the existence of the
          external data is not guaranteed.  This parameter may be
          used with ANY access-type and is ALWAYS optional.

    (3)   SIZE -- The size (in octets) of the data.  The intent
          of this parameter is to help the recipient decide
          whether or not to expend the necessary resources to
          retrieve the external data.  Note that this describes
          the size of the data in its canonical form, that is,
          before any Content-Transfer-Encoding has been applied
          or after the data have been decoded.  This parameter
          may be used with ANY access-type and is ALWAYS
          optional.

    (4)   PERMISSION -- A case-insensitive field that indicates
          whether or not it is expected that clients might also
          attempt to overwrite the data.  By default, or if
          permission is "read", the assumption is that they are
          not, and that if the data is retrieved once, it is
          never needed again.  If PERMISSION is "read-write",



Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                    [Page 34]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


          this assumption is invalid, and any local copy must be
          considered no more than a cache.  "Read" and "Read-
          write" are the only defined values of permission.  This
          parameter may be used with ANY access-type and is
          ALWAYS optional.

   The precise semantics of the access-types defined here are described
   in the sections that follow.

5.2.3.2.  The 'ftp' and 'tftp' Access-Types

   An access-type of FTP or TFTP indicates that the message body is
   accessible as a file using the FTP [RFC-959] or TFTP [RFC- 783]
   protocols, respectively.  For these access-types, the following
   additional parameters are mandatory:

    (1)   NAME -- The name of the file that contains the actual
          body data.

    (2)   SITE -- A machine from which the file may be obtained,
          using the given protocol.  This must be a fully
          qualified domain name, not a nickname.

    (3)   Before any data are retrieved, using FTP, the user will
          generally need to be asked to provide a login id and a
          password for the machine named by the site parameter.
          For security reasons, such an id and password are not
          specified as content-type parameters, but must be
          obtained from the user.

   In addition, the following parameters are optional:

    (1)   DIRECTORY -- A directory from which the data named by
          NAME should be retrieved.

    (2)   MODE -- A case-insensitive string indicating the mode
          to be used when retrieving the information.  The valid
          values for access-type "TFTP" are "NETASCII", "OCTET",
          and "MAIL", as specified by the TFTP protocol [RFC-
          783].  The valid values for access-type "FTP" are
          "ASCII", "EBCDIC", "IMAGE", and "LOCALn" where "n" is a
          decimal integer, typically 8.  These correspond to the
          representation types "A" "E" "I" and "L n" as specified
          by the FTP protocol [RFC-959].  Note that "BINARY" and
          "TENEX" are not valid values for MODE and that "OCTET"
          or "IMAGE" or "LOCAL8" should be used instead.  IF MODE
          is not specified, the  default value is "NETASCII" for
          TFTP and "ASCII" otherwise.



Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                    [Page 35]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


5.2.3.3.  The 'anon-ftp' Access-Type

   The "anon-ftp" access-type is identical to the "ftp" access type,
   except that the user need not be asked to provide a name and password
   for the specified site.  Instead, the ftp protocol will be used with
   login "anonymous" and a password that corresponds to the user's mail
   address.

5.2.3.4.  The 'local-file' Access-Type

   An access-type of "local-file" indicates that the actual body is
   accessible as a file on the local machine.  Two additional parameters
   are defined for this access type:

    (1)   NAME -- The name of the file that contains the actual
          body data.  This parameter is mandatory for the
          "local-file" access-type.

    (2)   SITE -- A domain specifier for a machine or set of
          machines that are known to have access to the data
          file.  This optional parameter is used to describe the
          locality of reference for the data, that is, the site
          or sites at which the file is expected to be visible.
          Asterisks may be used for wildcard matching to a part
          of a domain name, such as "*.bellcore.com", to indicate
          a set of machines on which the data should be directly
          visible, while a single asterisk may be used to
          indicate a file that is expected to be universally
          available, e.g., via a global file system.

5.2.3.5.  The 'mail-server' Access-Type

   The "mail-server" access-type indicates that the actual body is
   available from a mail server.  Two additional parameters are defined
   for this access-type:

    (1)   SERVER -- The addr-spec of the mail server from which
          the actual body data can be obtained.  This parameter
          is mandatory for the "mail-server" access-type.

    (2)   SUBJECT -- The subject that is to be used in the mail
          that is sent to obtain the data.  Note that keying mail
          servers on Subject lines is NOT recommended, but such
          mail servers are known to exist.  This is an optional
          parameter.






Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                    [Page 36]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


   Because mail servers accept a variety of syntaxes, some of which is
   multiline, the full command to be sent to a mail server is not
   included as a parameter in the content-type header field.  Instead,
   it is provided as the "phantom body" when the media type is
   "message/external-body" and the access-type is mail-server.

   Note that MIME does not define a mail server syntax.  Rather, it
   allows the inclusion of arbitrary mail server commands in the phantom
   body.  Implementations must include the phantom body in the body of
   the message it sends to the mail server address to retrieve the
   relevant data.

   Unlike other access-types, mail-server access is asynchronous and
   will happen at an unpredictable time in the future.  For this reason,
   it is important that there be a mechanism by which the returned data
   can be matched up with the original "message/external-body" entity.
   MIME mail servers must use the same Content-ID field on the returned
   message that was used in the original "message/external-body"
   entities, to facilitate such matching.

5.2.3.6.  External-Body Security Issues

   "Message/external-body" entities give rise to two important security
   issues:

    (1)   Accessing data via a "message/external-body" reference
          effectively results in the message recipient performing
          an operation that was specified by the message
          originator.  It is therefore possible for the message
          originator to trick a recipient into doing something
          they would not have done otherwise.  For example, an
          originator could specify a action that attempts
          retrieval of material that the recipient is not
          authorized to obtain, causing the recipient to
          unwittingly violate some security policy.  For this
          reason, user agents capable of resolving external
          references must always take steps to describe the
          action they are to take to the recipient and ask for
          explicit permisssion prior to performing it.

          The 'mail-server' access-type is particularly
          vulnerable, in that it causes the recipient to send a
          new message whose contents are specified by the
          original message's originator.  Given the potential for
          abuse, any such request messages that are constructed
          should contain a clear indication that they were
          generated automatically (e.g. in a Comments: header
          field) in an attempt to resolve a MIME



Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                    [Page 37]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


          "message/external-body" reference.

    (2)   MIME will sometimes be used in environments that
          provide some guarantee of message integrity and
          authenticity.  If present, such guarantees may apply
          only to the actual direct content of messages -- they
          may or may not apply to data accessed through MIME's
          "message/external-body" mechanism.  In particular, it
          may be possible to subvert certain access mechanisms
          even when the messaging system itself is secure.

          It should be noted that this problem exists either with
          or without the availabilty of MIME mechanisms.  A
          casual reference to an FTP site containing a document
          in the text of a secure message brings up similar
          issues -- the only difference is that MIME provides for
          automatic retrieval of such material, and users may
          place unwarranted trust is such automatic retrieval
          mechanisms.

5.2.3.7.  Examples and Further Explanations

   When the external-body mechanism is used in conjunction with the
   "multipart/alternative" media type it extends the functionality of
   "multipart/alternative" to include the case where the same entity is
   provided in the same format but via different accces mechanisms.
   When this is done the originator of the message must order the parts
   first in terms of preferred formats and then by preferred access
   mechanisms.  The recipient's viewer should then evaluate the list
   both in terms of format and access mechanisms.

   With the emerging possibility of very wide-area file systems, it
   becomes very hard to know in advance the set of machines where a file
   will and will not be accessible directly from the file system.
   Therefore it may make sense to provide both a file name, to be tried
   directly, and the name of one or more sites from which the file is
   known to be accessible.  An implementation can try to retrieve remote
   files using FTP or any other protocol, using anonymous file retrieval
   or prompting the user for the necessary name and password.  If an
   external body is accessible via multiple mechanisms, the sender may
   include multiple entities of type "message/external-body" within the
   body parts of an enclosing "multipart/alternative" entity.

   However, the external-body mechanism is not intended to be limited to
   file retrieval, as shown by the mail-server access-type.  Beyond
   this, one can imagine, for example, using a video server for external
   references to video clips.




Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                    [Page 38]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


   The embedded message header fields which appear in the body of the
   "message/external-body" data must be used to declare the media type
   of the external body if it is anything other than plain US-ASCII
   text, since the external body does not have a header section to
   declare its type.  Similarly, any Content-transfer-encoding other
   than "7bit" must also be declared here.  Thus a complete
   "message/external-body" message, referring to an object in PostScript
   format, might look like this:

     From: Whomever
     To: Someone
     Date: Whenever
     Subject: whatever

Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                    [Page 39]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


   Note that in the above examples, the default Content-transfer-
   encoding of "7bit" is assumed for the external postscript data.

   Like the "message/partial" type, the "message/external-body" media
   type is intended to be transparent, that is, to convey the data type
   in the external body rather than to convey a message with a body of
   that type.  Thus the headers on the outer and inner parts must be
   merged using the same rules as for "message/partial".  In particular,
   this means that the Content-type and Subject fields are overridden,
   but the From field is preserved.

   Note that since the external bodies are not transported along with
   the external body reference, they need not conform to transport
   limitations that apply to the reference itself. In particular,
   Internet mail transports may impose 7bit and line length limits, but
   these do not automatically apply to binary external body references.
   Thus a Content-Transfer-Encoding is not generally necessary, though
   it is permitted.

   Note that the body of a message of type "message/external-body" is
   governed by the basic syntax for an RFC 822 message.  In particular,
   anything before the first consecutive pair of CRLFs is header
   information, while anything after it is body information, which is
   ignored for most access-types.

5.2.4.  Other Message Subtypes

   MIME implementations must in general treat unrecognized subtypes of
   "message" as being equivalent to "application/octet-stream".

   Future subtypes of "message" intended for use with email should be
   restricted to "7bit" encoding. A type other than "message" should be
   used if restriction to "7bit" is not possible.

6.  Experimental Media Type Values

   A media type value beginning with the characters "X-" is a private
   value, to be used by consenting systems by mutual agreement.  Any
   format without a rigorous and public definition must be named with an
   "X-" prefix, and publicly specified values shall never begin with
   "X-".  (Older versions of the widely used Andrew system use the "X-
   BE2" name, so new systems should probably choose a different name.)

   In general, the use of "X-" top-level types is strongly discouraged.
   Implementors should invent subtypes of the existing types whenever
   possible. In many cases, a subtype of "application" will be more
   appropriate than a new top-level type.




Freed & Borenstein          Standards Track                    [Page 40]

RFC 2046                      Media Types                  November 1996


7.  Summary

   The five discrete media types provide provide a standardized
   mechanism for tagging entities as "audio", "image", or several other
   kinds of data. The composite "multipart" and "message" media types
   allow mixing and hierarchical structuring of entities of different
   types in a single message. A distinguished parameter syntax allows
   further specification of data format details, particularly the
   specification of alternate character sets.  Additional optional
   header fields provide mechanisms for certain extensions deemed
   desirable by many implementors. Finally, a number of useful media
   types are defined for general use by consenting user agents, notably
   "message/partial" and "message/external-body".

9.  Security Considerations

   Security issues are discussed in the context of the
   "application/postscript" type, the "message/external-body" type, and
   in RFC 2048.  Implementors should pay special attention to the
   security implications of any media types that can cause the remote
   execution of any actions in the recipient's environment.  In such
   cases, the discussion of the "application/postscript" type may serve
   as a model for considering other media types with remote execution
   capabilities.

Appendix A -- Collected Grammar

   This appendix contains the complete BNF grammar for all the syntax
   specified by this document.

   By itself, however, this grammar is incomplete.  It refers by name to
   several syntax rules that are defined by RFC 822.  Rather than
   reproduce those definitions here, and risk unintentional differences
   between the two, this document simply refers the reader to RFC 822
   for the remaining definitions. Wherever a term is undefined, it
   refers to the RFC 822 definition.

     boundary := 0*69<bchars> bcharsnospace

     bchars := bcharsnospace / " "

     bcharsnospace := DIGIT / ALPHA / "'" / "(" / ")" /
                      "+" / "_" / "," / "-" / "." /
                      "/" / ":" / "=" / "?"

     body-part := <"message" as defined in RFC 822, with all
                   header fields optional, not starting with the
                   specified dash-boundary, and with the
                   delimiter not occurring anywhere in the
                   body part.  Note that the semantics of a
                   part differ from the semantics of a message,
                   as described in the text.>

     close-delimiter := delimiter "--"

     dash-boundary := "--" boundary
                      ; boundary taken from the value of
                      ; boundary parameter of the
                      ; Content-Type field.

     delimiter := CRLF dash-boundary

     discard-text := *(*text CRLF)
                     ; May be ignored or discarded.

     encapsulation := delimiter transport-padding
                      CRLF body-part

     epilogue := discard-text

     multipart-body := [preamble CRLF]
                       dash-boundary transport-padding CRLF
                       body-part *encapsulation

Abstract
The IETF policies about Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), such as
patent rights, relative to technologies developed in the IETF are
designed to ensure that IETF working groups and participants have as
much information as possible about any IPR constraints on a technical
proposal as early as possible in the development process.  The
policies are intended to benefit the Internet community and the
public at large, while respecting the legitimate rights of IPR
holders.  This document sets out the IETF policies concerning IPR
related to technology worked on within the IETF.  It also
describes the objectives that the policies are designed to meet.
This document updates RFC 2026 and, with RFC 5378, replaces Section 10
of RFC 2026.  This document also obsoletes RFCs 3979 and 4879.

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005

1.  Introduction

   The comma separated values format (CSV) has been used for exchanging
   and converting data between various spreadsheet programs for quite
   some time.  Surprisingly, while this format is very common, it has
   never been formally documented.  Additionally, while the IANA MIME
   registration tree includes a registration for
   "text/tab-separated-values" type, no MIME types have ever been
   registered with IANA for CSV.  At the same time, various programs and
   operating systems have begun to use different MIME types for this
   format.  This RFC documents the format of comma separated values
   (CSV) files and formally registers the "text/csv" MIME type for CSV
   in accordance with RFC 2048 [1].

2.  Definition of the CSV Format

   While there are various specifications and implementations for the
   CSV format (for ex. [4], [5], [6] and [7]), there is no formal
   specification in existence, which allows for a wide variety of
   interpretations of CSV files.  This section documents the format that
   seems to be followed by most implementations:

   1.  Each record is located on a separate line, delimited by a line
       break (CRLF).  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF

   2.  The last record in the file may or may not have an ending line
       break.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   3.  There maybe an optional header line appearing as the first line
       of the file with the same format as normal record lines.  This
       header will contain names corresponding to the fields in the file
       and should contain the same number of fields as the records in
       the rest of the file (the presence or absence of the header line
       should be indicated via the optional "header" parameter of this
       MIME type).  For example:

       field_name,field_name,field_name CRLF
       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF

Shafranovich                 Informational                      [Page 2]
RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005

   4.  Within the header and each record, there may be one or more
       fields, separated by commas.  Each line should contain the same
       number of fields throughout the file.  Spaces are considered part
       of a field and should not be ignored.  The last field in the
       record must not be followed by a comma.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc

   5.  Each field may or may not be enclosed in double quotes (however
       some programs, such as Microsoft Excel, do not use double quotes
       at all).  If fields are not enclosed with double quotes, then
       double quotes may not appear inside the fields.  For example:

       "aaa","bbb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   6.  Fields containing line breaks (CRLF), double quotes, and commas
       should be enclosed in double-quotes.  For example:

       "aaa","b CRLF
       bb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   7.  If double-quotes are used to enclose fields, then a double-quote
       appearing inside a field must be escaped by preceding it with
       another double quote.  For example:

       "aaa","b""bb","ccc"

   The ABNF grammar [2] appears as follows:

   file = [header CRLF] record *(CRLF record) [CRLF]

   header = name *(COMMA name)

   record = field *(COMMA field)

   name = field

   field = (escaped / non-escaped)

   escaped = DQUOTE *(TEXTDATA / COMMA / CR / LF / 2DQUOTE) DQUOTE

   non-escaped = *TEXTDATA

   COMMA = %x2C

   CR = %x0D ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005

   DQUOTE =  %x22 ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   LF = %x0A ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   CRLF = CR LF ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   TEXTDATA =  %x20-21 / %x23-2B / %x2D-7E

3.  MIME Type Registration of text/csv

   This section provides the media-type registration application (as per
   RFC 2048 [1].

   To: ietf-types@iana.org

   Subject: Registration of MIME media type text/csv

   MIME media type name: text

   MIME subtype name: csv

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: charset, header

      Common usage of CSV is US-ASCII, but other character sets defined
      by IANA for the "text" tree may be used in conjunction with the
      "charset" parameter.

      The "header" parameter indicates the presence or absence of the
      header line.  Valid values are "present" or "absent".
      Implementors choosing not to use this parameter must make their
      own decisions as to whether the header line is present or absent.

   Encoding considerations:

      As per section 4.1.1. of RFC 2046 [3], this media type uses CRLF
      to denote line breaks.  However, implementors should be aware that
      some implementations may use other values.

   Security considerations:

      CSV files contain passive text data that should not pose any
      risks.  However, it is possible in theory that malicious binary
      data may be included in order to exploit potential buffer overruns
      in the program processing CSV data.  Additionally, private data
      may be shared via this format (which of course applies to any text
      data).

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005

   Interoperability considerations:

      Due to lack of a single specification, there are considerable
      differences among implementations.  Implementors should "be
      conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from
      others" (RFC 793 [8]) when processing CSV files.  An attempt at a
      common definition can be found in Section 2.

      Implementations deciding not to use the optional "header"
      parameter must make their own decision as to whether the header is
      absent or present.

   Published specification:

      While numerous private specifications exist for various programs
      and systems, there is no single "master" specification for this
      format.  An attempt at a common definition can be found in Section
      2.

   Applications that use this media type:

      Spreadsheet programs and various data conversion utilities

   Additional information:

      Magic number(s): none

      File extension(s): CSV

      Macintosh File Type Code(s): TEXT

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005

1.  Introduction

   The comma separated values format (CSV) has been used for exchanging
   and converting data between various spreadsheet programs for quite
   some time.  Surprisingly, while this format is very common, it has
   never been formally documented.  Additionally, while the IANA MIME
   registration tree includes a registration for
   "text/tab-separated-values" type, no MIME types have ever been
   registered with IANA for CSV.  At the same time, various programs and
   operating systems have begun to use different MIME types for this
   format.  This RFC documents the format of comma separated values
   (CSV) files and formally registers the "text/csv" MIME type for CSV
   in accordance with RFC 2048 [1].

2.  Definition of the CSV Format

   While there are various specifications and implementations for the
   CSV format (for ex. [4], [5], [6] and [7]), there is no formal
   specification in existence, which allows for a wide variety of
   interpretations of CSV files.  This section documents the format that
   seems to be followed by most implementations:

   1.  Each record is located on a separate line, delimited by a line
       break (CRLF).  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF

   2.  The last record in the file may or may not have an ending line
       break.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   3.  There maybe an optional header line appearing as the first line
       of the file with the same format as normal record lines.  This
       header will contain names corresponding to the fields in the file
       and should contain the same number of fields as the records in
       the rest of the file (the presence or absence of the header line
       should be indicated via the optional "header" parameter of this
       MIME type).  For example:

       field_name,field_name,field_name CRLF
       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF

Shafranovich                 Informational                      [Page 2]
RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005

   4.  Within the header and each record, there may be one or more
       fields, separated by commas.  Each line should contain the same
       number of fields throughout the file.  Spaces are considered part
       of a field and should not be ignored.  The last field in the
       record must not be followed by a comma.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc

   5.  Each field may or may not be enclosed in double quotes (however
       some programs, such as Microsoft Excel, do not use double quotes
       at all).  If fields are not enclosed with double quotes, then
       double quotes may not appear inside the fields.  For example:

       "aaa","bbb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   6.  Fields containing line breaks (CRLF), double quotes, and commas
       should be enclosed in double-quotes.  For example:

       "aaa","b CRLF
       bb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   7.  If double-quotes are used to enclose fields, then a double-quote
       appearing inside a field must be escaped by preceding it with
       another double quote.  For example:

       "aaa","b""bb","ccc"

   The ABNF grammar [2] appears as follows:

   file = [header CRLF] record *(CRLF record) [CRLF]

   header = name *(COMMA name)

   record = field *(COMMA field)

   name = field

   field = (escaped / non-escaped)

   escaped = DQUOTE *(TEXTDATA / COMMA / CR / LF / 2DQUOTE) DQUOTE

   non-escaped = *TEXTDATA

   COMMA = %x2C

   CR = %x0D ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005

   DQUOTE =  %x22 ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   LF = %x0A ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   CRLF = CR LF ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   TEXTDATA =  %x20-21 / %x23-2B / %x2D-7E

3.  MIME Type Registration of text/csv

   This section provides the media-type registration application (as per
   RFC 2048 [1].

   To: ietf-types@iana.org

   Subject: Registration of MIME media type text/csv

   MIME media type name: text

   MIME subtype name: csv

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: charset, header

      Common usage of CSV is US-ASCII, but other character sets defined
      by IANA for the "text" tree may be used in conjunction with the
      "charset" parameter.

      The "header" parameter indicates the presence or absence of the
      header line.  Valid values are "present" or "absent".
      Implementors choosing not to use this parameter must make their
      own decisions as to whether the header line is present or absent.

   Encoding considerations:

      As per section 4.1.1. of RFC 2046 [3], this media type uses CRLF
      to denote line breaks.  However, implementors should be aware that
      some implementations may use other values.

   Security considerations:

      CSV files contain passive text data that should not pose any
      risks.  However, it is possible in theory that malicious binary
      data may be included in order to exploit potential buffer overruns
      in the program processing CSV data.  Additionally, private data
      may be shared via this format (which of course applies to any text
      data).

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005

   Interoperability considerations:

      Due to lack of a single specification, there are considerable
      differences among implementations.  Implementors should "be
      conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from
      others" (RFC 793 [8]) when processing CSV files.  An attempt at a
      common definition can be found in Section 2.

      Implementations deciding not to use the optional "header"
      parameter must make their own decision as to whether the header is
      absent or present.

   Published specification:

      While numerous private specifications exist for various programs
      and systems, there is no single "master" specification for this
      format.  An attempt at a common definition can be found in Section
      2.

   Applications that use this media type:

      Spreadsheet programs and various data conversion utilities

   Additional information:

      Magic number(s): none

      File extension(s): CSV

      Macintosh File Type Code(s): TEXT

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005

1.  Introduction

   The comma separated values format (CSV) has been used for exchanging
   and converting data between various spreadsheet programs for quite
   some time.  Surprisingly, while this format is very common, it has
   never been formally documented.  Additionally, while the IANA MIME
   registration tree includes a registration for
   "text/tab-separated-values" type, no MIME types have ever been
   registered with IANA for CSV.  At the same time, various programs and
   operating systems have begun to use different MIME types for this
   format.  This RFC documents the format of comma separated values
   (CSV) files and formally registers the "text/csv" MIME type for CSV
   in accordance with RFC 2048 [1].

2.  Definition of the CSV Format

   While there are various specifications and implementations for the
   CSV format (for ex. [4], [5], [6] and [7]), there is no formal
   specification in existence, which allows for a wide variety of
   interpretations of CSV files.  This section documents the format that
   seems to be followed by most implementations:

   1.  Each record is located on a separate line, delimited by a line
       break (CRLF).  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF

   2.  The last record in the file may or may not have an ending line
       break.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   3.  There maybe an optional header line appearing as the first line
       of the file with the same format as normal record lines.  This
       header will contain names corresponding to the fields in the file
       and should contain the same number of fields as the records in
       the rest of the file (the presence or absence of the header line
       should be indicated via the optional "header" parameter of this
       MIME type).  For example:

       field_name,field_name,field_name CRLF
       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF

Shafranovich                 Informational                      [Page 2]
RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005

   4.  Within the header and each record, there may be one or more
       fields, separated by commas.  Each line should contain the same
       number of fields throughout the file.  Spaces are considered part
       of a field and should not be ignored.  The last field in the
       record must not be followed by a comma.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc

   5.  Each field may or may not be enclosed in double quotes (however
       some programs, such as Microsoft Excel, do not use double quotes
       at all).  If fields are not enclosed with double quotes, then
       double quotes may not appear inside the fields.  For example:

       "aaa","bbb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   6.  Fields containing line breaks (CRLF), double quotes, and commas
       should be enclosed in double-quotes.  For example:

       "aaa","b CRLF
       bb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   7.  If double-quotes are used to enclose fields, then a double-quote
       appearing inside a field must be escaped by preceding it with
       another double quote.  For example:

       "aaa","b""bb","ccc"

   The ABNF grammar [2] appears as follows:

   file = [header CRLF] record *(CRLF record) [CRLF]

   header = name *(COMMA name)

   record = field *(COMMA field)

   name = field

   field = (escaped / non-escaped)

   escaped = DQUOTE *(TEXTDATA / COMMA / CR / LF / 2DQUOTE) DQUOTE

   non-escaped = *TEXTDATA

   COMMA = %x2C

   CR = %x0D ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005

   DQUOTE =  %x22 ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   LF = %x0A ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   CRLF = CR LF ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   TEXTDATA =  %x20-21 / %x23-2B / %x2D-7E

3.  MIME Type Registration of text/csv

   This section provides the media-type registration application (as per
   RFC 2048 [1].

   To: ietf-types@iana.org

   Subject: Registration of MIME media type text/csv

   MIME media type name: text

   MIME subtype name: csv

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: charset, header

      Common usage of CSV is US-ASCII, but other character sets defined
      by IANA for the "text" tree may be used in conjunction with the
      "charset" parameter.

      The "header" parameter indicates the presence or absence of the
      header line.  Valid values are "present" or "absent".
      Implementors choosing not to use this parameter must make their
      own decisions as to whether the header line is present or absent.

   Encoding considerations:

      As per section 4.1.1. of RFC 2046 [3], this media type uses CRLF
      to denote line breaks.  However, implementors should be aware that
      some implementations may use other values.

   Security considerations:

      CSV files contain passive text data that should not pose any
      risks.  However, it is possible in theory that malicious binary
      data may be included in order to exploit potential buffer overruns
      in the program processing CSV data.  Additionally, private data
      may be shared via this format (which of course applies to any text
      data).

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005

   Interoperability considerations:

      Due to lack of a single specification, there are considerable
      differences among implementations.  Implementors should "be
      conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from
      others" (RFC 793 [8]) when processing CSV files.  An attempt at a
      common definition can be found in Section 2.

      Implementations deciding not to use the optional "header"
      parameter must make their own decision as to whether the header is
      absent or present.

   Published specification:

      While numerous private specifications exist for various programs
      and systems, there is no single "master" specification for this
      format.  An attempt at a common definition can be found in Section
      2.

   Applications that use this media type:

      Spreadsheet programs and various data conversion utilities

   Additional information:

      Magic number(s): none

      File extension(s): CSV

      Macintosh File Type Code(s): TEXT

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005

1.  Introduction

   The comma separated values format (CSV) has been used for exchanging
   and converting data between various spreadsheet programs for quite
   some time.  Surprisingly, while this format is very common, it has
   never been formally documented.  Additionally, while the IANA MIME
   registration tree includes a registration for
   "text/tab-separated-values" type, no MIME types have ever been
   registered with IANA for CSV.  At the same time, various programs and
   operating systems have begun to use different MIME types for this
   format.  This RFC documents the format of comma separated values
   (CSV) files and formally registers the "text/csv" MIME type for CSV
   in accordance with RFC 2048 [1].

2.  Definition of the CSV Format

   While there are various specifications and implementations for the
   CSV format (for ex. [4], [5], [6] and [7]), there is no formal
   specification in existence, which allows for a wide variety of
   interpretations of CSV files.  This section documents the format that
   seems to be followed by most implementations:

   1.  Each record is located on a separate line, delimited by a line
       break (CRLF).  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF

   2.  The last record in the file may or may not have an ending line
       break.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   3.  There maybe an optional header line appearing as the first line
       of the file with the same format as normal record lines.  This
       header will contain names corresponding to the fields in the file
       and should contain the same number of fields as the records in
       the rest of the file (the presence or absence of the header line
       should be indicated via the optional "header" parameter of this
       MIME type).  For example:

       field_name,field_name,field_name CRLF
       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005

   4.  Within the header and each record, there may be one or more
       fields, separated by commas.  Each line should contain the same
       number of fields throughout the file.  Spaces are considered part
       of a field and should not be ignored.  The last field in the
       record must not be followed by a comma.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc

   5.  Each field may or may not be enclosed in double quotes (however
       some programs, such as Microsoft Excel, do not use double quotes
       at all).  If fields are not enclosed with double quotes, then
       double quotes may not appear inside the fields.  For example:

       "aaa","bbb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   6.  Fields containing line breaks (CRLF), double quotes, and commas
       should be enclosed in double-quotes.  For example:

       "aaa","b CRLF
       bb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   7.  If double-quotes are used to enclose fields, then a double-quote
       appearing inside a field must be escaped by preceding it with
       another double quote.  For example:

       "aaa","b""bb","ccc"

   The ABNF grammar [2] appears as follows:

   file = [header CRLF] record *(CRLF record) [CRLF]

   header = name *(COMMA name)

   record = field *(COMMA field)

   name = field

   field = (escaped / non-escaped)

   escaped = DQUOTE *(TEXTDATA / COMMA / CR / LF / 2DQUOTE) DQUOTE

   non-escaped = *TEXTDATA

   COMMA = %x2C

   CR = %x0D ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   DQUOTE =  %x22 ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   LF = %x0A ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   CRLF = CR LF ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   TEXTDATA =  %x20-21 / %x23-2B / %x2D-7E

3.  MIME Type Registration of text/csv

   This section provides the media-type registration application (as per
   RFC 2048 [1].

   To: ietf-types@iana.org

   Subject: Registration of MIME media type text/csv

   MIME media type name: text

   MIME subtype name: csv

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: charset, header

      Common usage of CSV is US-ASCII, but other character sets defined
      by IANA for the "text" tree may be used in conjunction with the
      "charset" parameter.

      The "header" parameter indicates the presence or absence of the
      header line.  Valid values are "present" or "absent".
      Implementors choosing not to use this parameter must make their
      own decisions as to whether the header line is present or absent.

   Encoding considerations:

      As per section 4.1.1. of RFC 2046 [3], this media type uses CRLF
      to denote line breaks.  However, implementors should be aware that
      some implementations may use other values.

   Security considerations:

      CSV files contain passive text data that should not pose any
      risks.  However, it is possible in theory that malicious binary
      data may be included in order to exploit potential buffer overruns
      in the program processing CSV data.  Additionally, private data
      may be shared via this format (which of course applies to any text
      data).

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005

   Interoperability considerations:

      Due to lack of a single specification, there are considerable
      differences among implementations.  Implementors should "be
      conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from
      others" (RFC 793 [8]) when processing CSV files.  An attempt at a
      common definition can be found in Section 2.

      Implementations deciding not to use the optional "header"
      parameter must make their own decision as to whether the header is
      absent or present.

   Published specification:

      While numerous private specifications exist for various programs
      and systems, there is no single "master" specification for this
      format.  An attempt at a common definition can be found in Section
      2.

   Applications that use this media type:

      Spreadsheet programs and various data conversion utilities

   Additional information:

      Magic number(s): none

      File extension(s): CSV

      Macintosh File Type Code(s): TEXT

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005

1.  Introduction

   The comma separated values format (CSV) has been used for exchanging
   and converting data between various spreadsheet programs for quite
   some time.  Surprisingly, while this format is very common, it has
   never been formally documented.  Additionally, while the IANA MIME
   registration tree includes a registration for
   "text/tab-separated-values" type, no MIME types have ever been
   registered with IANA for CSV.  At the same time, various programs and
   operating systems have begun to use different MIME types for this
   format.  This RFC documents the format of comma separated values
   (CSV) files and formally registers the "text/csv" MIME type for CSV
   in accordance with RFC 2048 [1].

2.  Definition of the CSV Format

   While there are various specifications and implementations for the
   CSV format (for ex. [4], [5], [6] and [7]), there is no formal
   specification in existence, which allows for a wide variety of
   interpretations of CSV files.  This section documents the format that
   seems to be followed by most implementations:

   1.  Each record is located on a separate line, delimited by a line
       break (CRLF).  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF

   2.  The last record in the file may or may not have an ending line
       break.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   3.  There maybe an optional header line appearing as the first line
       of the file with the same format as normal record lines.  This
       header will contain names corresponding to the fields in the file
       and should contain the same number of fields as the records in
       the rest of the file (the presence or absence of the header line
       should be indicated via the optional "header" parameter of this
       MIME type).  For example:

       field_name,field_name,field_name CRLF
       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF

Shafranovich                 Informational                      [Page 2]
RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005

   4.  Within the header and each record, there may be one or more
       fields, separated by commas.  Each line should contain the same
       number of fields throughout the file.  Spaces are considered part
       of a field and should not be ignored.  The last field in the
       record must not be followed by a comma.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc

   5.  Each field may or may not be enclosed in double quotes (however
       some programs, such as Microsoft Excel, do not use double quotes
       at all).  If fields are not enclosed with double quotes, then
       double quotes may not appear inside the fields.  For example:

       "aaa","bbb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   6.  Fields containing line breaks (CRLF), double quotes, and commas
       should be enclosed in double-quotes.  For example:

       "aaa","b CRLF
       bb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   7.  If double-quotes are used to enclose fields, then a double-quote
       appearing inside a field must be escaped by preceding it with
       another double quote.  For example:

       "aaa","b""bb","ccc"

   The ABNF grammar [2] appears as follows:

   file = [header CRLF] record *(CRLF record) [CRLF]

   header = name *(COMMA name)

   record = field *(COMMA field)

   name = field

   field = (escaped / non-escaped)

   escaped = DQUOTE *(TEXTDATA / COMMA / CR / LF / 2DQUOTE) DQUOTE

   non-escaped = *TEXTDATA

   COMMA = %x2C

   CR = %x0D ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   DQUOTE =  %x22 ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   LF = %x0A ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   CRLF = CR LF ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   TEXTDATA =  %x20-21 / %x23-2B / %x2D-7E

3.  MIME Type Registration of text/csv

   This section provides the media-type registration application (as per
   RFC 2048 [1].

   To: ietf-types@iana.org

   Subject: Registration of MIME media type text/csv

   MIME media type name: text

   MIME subtype name: csv

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: charset, header

      Common usage of CSV is US-ASCII, but other character sets defined
      by IANA for the "text" tree may be used in conjunction with the
      "charset" parameter.

      The "header" parameter indicates the presence or absence of the
      header line.  Valid values are "present" or "absent".
      Implementors choosing not to use this parameter must make their
      own decisions as to whether the header line is present or absent.

   Encoding considerations:

      As per section 4.1.1. of RFC 2046 [3], this media type uses CRLF
      to denote line breaks.  However, implementors should be aware that
      some implementations may use other values.

   Security considerations:

      CSV files contain passive text data that should not pose any
      risks.  However, it is possible in theory that malicious binary
      data may be included in order to exploit potential buffer overruns
      in the program processing CSV data.  Additionally, private data
      may be shared via this format (which of course applies to any text
      data).

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005

   Interoperability considerations:

      Due to lack of a single specification, there are considerable
      differences among implementations.  Implementors should "be
      conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from
      others" (RFC 793 [8]) when processing CSV files.  An attempt at a
      common definition can be found in Section 2.

      Implementations deciding not to use the optional "header"
      parameter must make their own decision as to whether the header is
      absent or present.

   Published specification:

      While numerous private specifications exist for various programs
      and systems, there is no single "master" specification for this
      format.  An attempt at a common definition can be found in Section
      2.

   Applications that use this media type:

      Spreadsheet programs and various data conversion utilities

   Additional information:

      Magic number(s): none

      File extension(s): CSV

      Macintosh File Type Code(s): TEXT

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005

1.  Introduction

   The comma separated values format (CSV) has been used for exchanging
   and converting data between various spreadsheet programs for quite
   some time.  Surprisingly, while this format is very common, it has
   never been formally documented.  Additionally, while the IANA MIME
   registration tree includes a registration for
   "text/tab-separated-values" type, no MIME types have ever been
   registered with IANA for CSV.  At the same time, various programs and
   operating systems have begun to use different MIME types for this
   format.  This RFC documents the format of comma separated values
   (CSV) files and formally registers the "text/csv" MIME type for CSV
   in accordance with RFC 2048 [1].

2.  Definition of the CSV Format

   While there are various specifications and implementations for the
   CSV format (for ex. [4], [5], [6] and [7]), there is no formal
   specification in existence, which allows for a wide variety of
   interpretations of CSV files.  This section documents the format that
   seems to be followed by most implementations:

   1.  Each record is located on a separate line, delimited by a line
       break (CRLF).  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF

   2.  The last record in the file may or may not have an ending line
       break.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   3.  There maybe an optional header line appearing as the first line
       of the file with the same format as normal record lines.  This
       header will contain names corresponding to the fields in the file
       and should contain the same number of fields as the records in
       the rest of the file (the presence or absence of the header line
       should be indicated via the optional "header" parameter of this
       MIME type).  For example:

       field_name,field_name,field_name CRLF
       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF

Shafranovich                 Informational                      [Page 2]
RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005

   4.  Within the header and each record, there may be one or more
       fields, separated by commas.  Each line should contain the same
       number of fields throughout the file.  Spaces are considered part
       of a field and should not be ignored.  The last field in the
       record must not be followed by a comma.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc

   5.  Each field may or may not be enclosed in double quotes (however
       some programs, such as Microsoft Excel, do not use double quotes
       at all).  If fields are not enclosed with double quotes, then
       double quotes may not appear inside the fields.  For example:

       "aaa","bbb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   6.  Fields containing line breaks (CRLF), double quotes, and commas
       should be enclosed in double-quotes.  For example:

       "aaa","b CRLF
       bb","ccc" CRLF

   7.  If double-quotes are used to enclose fields, then a double-quote
       appearing inside a field must be escaped by preceding it with
       another double quote.  For example:

       "aaa","b""bb","ccc"

   The ABNF grammar [2] appears as follows:

   file = [header CRLF] record *(CRLF record) [CRLF]

   header = name *(COMMA name)

   record = field *(COMMA field)

   name = field

   field = (escaped / non-escaped)

   escaped = DQUOTE *(TEXTDATA / COMMA / CR / LF / 2DQUOTE) DQUOTE

   non-escaped = *TEXTDATA

   COMMA = %x2C

   CR = %x0D ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005

   DQUOTE =  %x22 ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   LF = %x0A ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   CRLF = CR LF ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]

   TEXTDATA =  %x20-21 / %x23-2B / %x2D-7E

3.  MIME Type Registration of text/csv

   This section provides the media-type registration application (as per
   RFC 2048 [1].

   To: ietf-types@iana.org

   Subject: Registration of MIME media type text/csv

   MIME media type name: text

   MIME subtype name: csv

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: charset, header

      Common usage of CSV is US-ASCII, but other character sets defined
      by IANA for the "text" tree may be used in conjunction with the
      "charset" parameter.

      The "header" parameter indicates the presence or absence of the
      header line.  Valid values are "present" or "absent".
      Implementors choosing not to use this parameter must make their
      own decisions as to whether the header line is present or absent.

   Encoding considerations:

      As per section 4.1.1. of RFC 2046 [3], this media type uses CRLF
      to denote line breaks.  However, implementors should be aware that
      some implementations may use other values.

   Security considerations:

      CSV files contain passive text data that should not pose any
      risks.  However, it is possible in theory that malicious binary
      data may be included in order to exploit potential buffer overruns
      in the program processing CSV data.  Additionally, private data
      may be shared via this format (which of course applies to any text
      data).

Shafranovich                 Informational                      [Page 4]
RFC 4180       Common Format and MIME Type for CSV Files    October 2005

   Interoperability considerations:

      Due to lack of a single specification, there are considerable
      differences among implementations.  Implementors should "be
      conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from
      others" (RFC 793 [8]) when processing CSV files.  An attempt at a
      common definition can be found in Section 2.

      Implementations deciding not to use the optional "header"
      parameter must make their own decision as to whether the header is
      absent or present.

   Published specification:

      While numerous private specifications exist for various programs
      and systems, there is no single "master" specification for this
      format.  An attempt at a common definition can be found in Section
      2.

   Applications that use this media type:

      Spreadsheet programs and various data conversion utilities

   Additional information:

      Magic number(s): none

      File extension(s): CSV

      Macintosh File Type Code(s): TEXT

                    In many areas, the Area Directors have formed an advisory group or directorate.  These comprise experienced members of the IETF and the technical community represented by the area.  The specific name and the details of the role for each group differ from area to area, but  the primary intent is that these groups assist the Area Director(s), e.g., with the review of specifications produced in the area.

        The IETF divides its work into a number of areas, each comprised of working groups that relate to that area's focus. The area structure is defined by the IESG, and the IESG can add areas, redefine areas, merge areas, change the number of ADs assigned to an area, or close down areas.
    
    
        Changes to the area structure affect the IETF in many ways; decisions to change the area structure are taken in consultation with the community.
    
    
        When changing the area structure, the IESG can decide which members are responsible for new and changed areas, including making one sitting AD responsible for multiple areas, but the IESG can only add new members through the
        NomCom process.
    
    
        The primary task of area management is handled by one or two Area Directors per area. An AD may be advised by one or more directorates, which are created, selected, chaired and if necessary disbanded by the AD. Directorates may be specific to an area, specific to a technology, or chartered in some other fashion.
    
    
        The ADs for an area are jointly responsible for making sure the WGs in the area are well coordinated, that there is coverage for the technologies needed in the area, and that the challenges most important to the Internet in that area are indeed being worked on.
    
    
        For more information about the role of the IESG in areas and working groups, please see
        RFC 3710 ("An IESG charter"),
        Section 6 and
        RFC 2418 ("IETF Working Group Guidelines and Procedures").
    
    
        A full list of active working groups, sorted by area, may be found at
        
            /wg/
        .
    
    
        The IESG decides which areas working groups belong to. The charter of each area is listed below:
    
    
        
            
                ART – Applications and Real-Time Area
            
        
            
                GEN – General Area
            
        
            
                INT – Internet Area
            
        
            
                OPS – Operations and Management Area
            
        
            
                RTG – Routing Area

            Applications and Real-Time Area
            (ART)
        
        
            
                The ART Area works on the application layer and related protocols:

Real-time applications.

- These are protocols that enable interactive human-to-human communication (see RFC 3550). Groups in this category are working on things such as real-time web communications, teleconferencing, emergency services communication, internet telephony, and instant messaging.

Traditional applications. 

- These are the protocols we've generally thought of in relation to the application layer. They include such things as email, calendaring, directory services, provisioning and access protocols related to DNS and IP and support for constrained environments.

Application building blocks. 

- These are designed to be used with a variety of more specific applications. They include compression, codecs, internationalization; JSON, XML, and CBOR; media types; URNs; and URI schemes.

            Operations and Management Area
            (OPS)
        
        
            
                The primary technical areas covered by the Operations & Management (OPS) Area include: Network Management, AAA, and various operational issues facing the Internet such as DNS operations, IPv6 operations, operational security and Routing operations.

Unlike most IETF areas, the Operations & Management area is logically divided into two separate functions: Network Management and Operations.

The Network Management function covers Internet management and AAA, and the related protocols, including but not limited to NETCONF, SNMP, RADIUS, Diameter, and CAPWAP, and of data modeling and data modeling languages used in management such as SMI and YANG. Another important role of the Management function is to identify potential or actual management issues regarding IETF protocols and documents in all areas, and to work with the other areas to resolve those issues.

The Operations function is largely responsible for soliciting operator feedback and input regarding IETF work. Another important role of the Operations function is to identify potential or actual operational issues regarding IETF protocols and documents in all areas, and to work with the other areas to resolve those issues.

The OPS area intersects most often with the Routing, Internet and Security areas.

            Routing Area
            (RTG)
        
        
            
                The Routing Area is responsible for facilitating the operation of the Internet routing system by maintaining and improving the scalability and stability characteristics of the existing routing protocols and developing new protocols, extensions, and bug fixes. Forwarding methods (such as destination-based unicast and multicast forwarding, MPLS, and pseudowire) as well as associated routing and signaling protocols (such as OSPF, IS-IS, BGP, RSVP-TE, LDP, PIM, RPL, and VPNs at Layer 2 and Layer 3), and both centralized and distributed routing architectures (to address, for example, virtualization, service chaining, traffic engineering, and data center routing) are within the scope of the Routing Area. The interactions of routing systems with configuration and orchestration platforms (for example, routing-related YANG models and path computation engines) are handled in the Routing Area as well. 

The Routing Area also works on Generalized MPLS used in the control plane of optical networks, and the security and manageability aspects of the routing system. The Routing Area Working Groups cover a wide range of data plane technologies (Layer 1, Layer 2, Layer 3) and control protocols. 

The Routing Area intersects most frequently with the Internet Area, the Operations and Management Area, and the Security Area. Interaction with the Internet Area concentrates mainly on IP forwarding and encapsulation. Ongoing work with the Operations and Management Area is on developing YANG models and considering the management and operation of the routing infrastructure. With the Security Area, the ongoing focus is on routing protocol security and its impact on the Internet's infrastructure security.

Work in the Routing Area often overlaps with work in other standards development organizations (SDOs). In particular, there have been interactions with Broadband Forum, IEEE, and ITU-T.

            Security Area
            (SEC)
        
        
            
                The Security Area is the home for working groups focused on security protocols. They provide one or more of the security services: integrity, authentication, non-repudiation, confidentiality, and access control. Since many of the security mechanisms needed to provide these security services employ cryptography, key management is also vital.

The Security Area intersects with all other IETF Areas, and the participants are frequently involved with activities in the working groups from other areas. This involvement focuses upon practical application of Security Area protocols and technologies to the protocols of other Areas.

                Close\n\nAreas
    
        The IETF divides its work into a number of areas, each comprised of working groups that relate to that area's focus. The area structure is defined by the IESG, and the IESG can add areas, redefine areas, merge areas, change the number of ADs assigned to an area, or close down areas.
    
    
        Changes to the area structure affect the IETF in many ways; decisions to change the area structure are taken in consultation with the community.
    
    
        When changing the area structure, the IESG can decide which members are responsible for new and changed areas, including making one sitting AD responsible for multiple areas, but the IESG can only add new members through the
        NomCom process.
    
    
        The primary task of area management is handled by one or two Area Directors per area. An AD may be advised by one or more directorates, which are created, selected, chaired and if necessary disbanded by the AD. Directorates may be specific to an area, specific to a technology, or chartered in some other fashion.
    
    
        The ADs for an area are jointly responsible for making sure the WGs in the area are well coordinated, that there is coverage for the technologies needed in the area, and that the challenges most important to the Internet in that area are indeed being worked on.
    
    
        For more information about the role of the IESG in areas and working groups, please see
        RFC 3710 ("An IESG charter"),
        Section 6 and
        RFC 2418 ("IETF Working Group Guidelines and Procedures").

            Operations and Management Area
            (OPS)
        
        
            
                The primary technical areas covered by the Operations & Management (OPS) Area include: Network Management, AAA, and various operational issues facing the Internet such as DNS operations, IPv6 operations, operational security and Routing operations.

Unlike most IETF areas, the Operations & Management area is logically divided into two separate functions: Network Management and Operations.

The Network Management function covers Internet management and AAA, and the related protocols, including but not limited to NETCONF, SNMP, RADIUS, Diameter, and CAPWAP, and of data modeling and data modeling languages used in management such as SMI and YANG. Another important role of the Management function is to identify potential or actual management issues regarding IETF protocols and documents in all areas, and to work with the other areas to resolve those issues.

The Operations function is largely responsible for soliciting operator feedback and input regarding IETF work. Another important role of the Operations function is to identify potential or actual operational issues regarding IETF protocols and documents in all areas, and to work with the other areas to resolve those issues.

The OPS area intersects most often with the Routing, Internet and Security areas.

            Routing Area
            (RTG)
        
        
            
                The Routing Area is responsible for facilitating the operation of the Internet routing system by maintaining and improving the scalability and stability characteristics of the existing routing protocols and developing new protocols, extensions, and bug fixes. Forwarding methods (such as destination-based unicast and multicast forwarding, MPLS, and pseudowire) as well as associated routing and signaling protocols (such as OSPF, IS-IS, BGP, RSVP-TE, LDP, PIM, RPL, and VPNs at Layer 2 and Layer 3), and both centralized and distributed routing architectures (to address, for example, virtualization, service chaining, traffic engineering, and data center routing) are within the scope of the Routing Area. The interactions of routing systems with configuration and orchestration platforms (for example, routing-related YANG models and path computation engines) are handled in the Routing Area as well. 

The Routing Area also works on Generalized MPLS used in the control plane of optical networks, and the security and manageability aspects of the routing system. The Routing Area Working Groups cover a wide range of data plane technologies (Layer 1, Layer 2, Layer 3) and control protocols. 

The Routing Area intersects most frequently with the Internet Area, the Operations and Management Area, and the Security Area. Interaction with the Internet Area concentrates mainly on IP forwarding and encapsulation. Ongoing work with the Operations and Management Area is on developing YANG models and considering the management and operation of the routing infrastructure. With the Security Area, the ongoing focus is on routing protocol security and its impact on the Internet's infrastructure security.

Work in the Routing Area often overlaps with work in other standards development organizations (SDOs). In particular, there have been interactions with Broadband Forum, IEEE, and ITU-T.

            Security Area

                The Security Area is the home for working groups focused on security protocols. They provide one or more of the security services: integrity, authentication, non-repudiation, confidentiality, and access control. Since many of the security mechanisms needed to provide these security services employ cryptography, key management is also vital.

The Security Area intersects with all other IETF Areas, and the participants are frequently involved with activities in the working groups from other areas. This involvement focuses upon practical application of Security Area protocols and technologies to the protocols of other Areas.

        The IETF divides its work into a number of areas, each comprised of working groups that relate to that area's focus. The area structure is defined by the IESG, and the IESG can add areas, redefine areas, merge areas, change the number of ADs assigned to an area, or close down areas.
    
    
        Changes to the area structure affect the IETF in many ways; decisions to change the area structure are taken in consultation with the community.
    
    
        When changing the area structure, the IESG can decide which members are responsible for new and changed areas, including making one sitting AD responsible for multiple areas, but the IESG can only add new members through the
        NomCom process.
    
    
        The primary task of area management is handled by one or two Area Directors per area. An AD may be advised by one or more directorates, which are created, selected, chaired and if necessary disbanded by the AD. Directorates may be specific to an area, specific to a technology, or chartered in some other fashion.
    
    
        The ADs for an area are jointly responsible for making sure the WGs in the area are well coordinated, that there is coverage for the technologies needed in the area, and that the challenges most important to the Internet in that area are indeed being worked on.
    
    
        For more information about the role of the IESG in areas and working groups, please see
        RFC 3710 ("An IESG charter"),
        Section 6 and
        RFC 2418 ("IETF Working Group Guidelines and Procedures").

                The ART Area works on the application layer and related protocols:

Real-time applications.

- These are protocols that enable interactive human-to-human communication (see RFC 3550). Groups in this category are working on things such as real-time web communications, teleconferencing, emergency services communication, internet telephony, and instant messaging.

Traditional applications. 

- These are the protocols we've generally thought of in relation to the application layer. They include such things as email, calendaring, directory services, provisioning and access protocols related to DNS and IP and support for constrained environments.

Application building blocks. 

- These are designed to be used with a variety of more specific applications. They include compression, codecs, internationalization; JSON, XML, and CBOR; media types; URNs; and URI schemes.

Work in the Routing Area often overlaps with work in other standards development organizations (SDOs). In particular, there have been interactions with Broadband Forum, IEEE, and ITU-T.

            Security Area
            (SEC)
        
        
            
                The Security Area is the home for working groups focused on security protocols. They provide one or more of the security services: integrity, authentication, non-repudiation, confidentiality, and access control. Since many of the security mechanisms needed to provide these security services employ cryptography, key management is also vital.

The Security Area intersects with all other IETF Areas, and the participants are frequently involved with activities in the working groups from other areas. This involvement focuses upon practical application of Security Area protocols and technologies to the protocols of other Areas.

                The Web and Internet Transport (WIT) area covers protocols that provide the functions of the Transport Layer of the Internet, such as QUIC, TCP, UDP, SCTP, and DCCP, including congestion control and queue management.  It also has responsibility for protocols that implement the World Wide Web (like HTTP) and adjacent technologies.
