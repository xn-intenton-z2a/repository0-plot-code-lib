# TEMPLATE_LITERALS

## Crawl Summary
The crawled content from MDN describes JavaScript template literals, detailing multi-line strings, string interpolation, escape sequence handling, and advanced tagged templates. It explains syntax, parameters, code examples, error scenarios, and provides best practices for effective usage.

## Normalised Extract
Summary: JavaScript template literals are a modern, versatile way to work with strings that support multi-line text, interpolation, and advanced manipulations via tagged templates.

Table of Contents:
1. Overview
2. Syntax & Examples
3. Tagged Templates
4. Escape Sequences
5. Best Practices

Overview: Template literals, delimited by backticks, enable clear and readable string construction. They support embedded expressions and multi-line constructs, replacing cumbersome concatenation.

Syntax & Examples: The syntax uses backticks (`) to define strings and placeholders (${expression}). Examples illustrate multi-line strings and how interpolation improves readability compared to the use of the plus operator.

Tagged Templates: This advanced feature passes the template parts to a function, allowing custom processing. Detailed examples show how tag functions can return non-string values or perform caching using the immutable strings array.

Escape Sequences: Special attention is given to escaping backticks and dollar signs. The content distinguishes between cooked and raw string representations and explains error handling for malformed sequences.

Best Practices: Developers are advised to leverage template literals for clarity and maintainability, using tagged templates for dynamic formatting and ensuring proper handling of escape sequences to prevent runtime errors.

## Supplementary Details
Recent developments in JavaScript further emphasize the importance of template literals in modern coding practices. With ES6 being the standard, template literals now serve as a foundation for writing cleaner, more maintainable code and are integrated into many modern frameworks and libraries which streamline component-based architecture and internationalization efforts.

## Reference Details
API Specifications & Code Examples:

- Basic Syntax: `const str = `Hello ${name}!`;`
- Multi-line Example: `console.log(`Line one\nLine two`);`
- Tagged Template Example:
  ```javascript
  function myTag(strings, ...values) {
    const result = strings[0] + values.join('') + strings[1];
    return result;
  }
  const output = myTag`Hello, ${'world'}!`;
  ```

Parameters:
- strings: Array of literal strings.
- expressions: Values injected into placeholders.

Implementation Patterns:
- Using tagged templates for custom formatting and caching the literal array for efficient reuse.

Configuration Options & Best Practices:
- Always escape backticks using a backslash, e.g. `\``.
- Use String.raw for obtaining unprocessed string content when needed.

Troubleshooting Guides:
- Common issues include malformed escape sequences causing syntax errors â€“ validate all literal parts for proper formatting.
