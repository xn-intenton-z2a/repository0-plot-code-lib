## Reference Details
The crawl did not yield complete API specifications. For full API details, including method signatures with complete parameter lists and return types, full SDK method examples, and exact technical configuration details, please consult the official Sharp API documentation. Key examples include:

- **Example Method Signature**: (Not available in crawl; refer to source)
- **Code Example**: 

  ```javascript
  const sharp = require('sharp');
  // Example usage (parameters and return types must be confirmed via documentation)
  sharp('input.jpg')
    .resize(200, 300)
    .toFile('output.jpg', (err, info) => {
      if (err) {
        console.error('Error processing image:', err);
      } else {
        console.log('Image processed successfully:', info);
      }
    });
  ```
