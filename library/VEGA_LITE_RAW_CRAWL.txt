  Vega-Lite is a high-level grammar of interactive graphics. It provides a concise, declarative JSON syntax to create an expressive range of visualizations for data analysis and presentation.



  
    Vega-Lite specifications describe visualizations as encoding mappings from data to properties of graphical marks (e.g., points or bars).
    The Vega-Lite compiler automatically produces visualization components including axes, legends, and scales.
    It determines default properties of these components based on a set of carefully designed rules.
    This approach allows Vega-Lite specifications to be concise for quick visualization authoring, while giving user control to override defaults and customize various parts of a visualization.
    As we also designed Vega-Lite to support data analysis, Vega-Lite supports both data transformations (e.g., aggregation, binning, filtering, sorting) and visual transformations (e.g., stacking and faceting).
    Moreover, Vega-Lite specifications can be composed into layered and multi-view displays, and made interactive with selections.

Compared to Vega, Vega-Lite provides a more concise and convenient form to author common visualizations. As Vega-Lite can compile its specifications to Vega specifications, users may use Vega-Lite as the primary visualization tool and, if needed, transition to use the lower-level Vega for advanced use cases.

For more information, read our introduction article to Vega-Lite v2 on Medium, watch our OpenVis Conf talk about the new features in Vega-Lite v2, see the documentation and take a look at our example gallery. Follow us on Twitter at @vega_vis to stay informed about updates.

Example


  
    With Vega-Lite, we can start with a bar chart of the average monthly precipitation in Seattle, overlay a rule for the overall yearly average, and have it represent an interactive moving average for a dragged region.

    Vega – A Visualization Grammar
  






  
    Vega is a visualization grammar, a declarative language for creating, saving, and sharing interactive visualization designs. With Vega, you can describe the visual appearance and interactive behavior of a visualization in a JSON format, and generate web-based views using Canvas or SVG.

Version 5.31.0

Vega provides basic building blocks for a wide variety of visualization designs: data loading and transformation, scales, map projections, axes, legends, and graphical marks such as rectangles, lines, plotting symbols, etc. Interaction techniques can be specified using reactive signals that dynamically modify a visualization in response to input event streams.

A Vega specification defines an interactive visualization in a JSON format. Specifications are parsed by Vega’s JavaScript runtime to generate both static images or interactive web-based views. Vega provides a convenient representation for computational generation of visualizations, and can serve as a foundation for new APIs and visual analysis tools.

To get started with Vega, take a look at the tutorials, example gallery, and usage guide, or read about the project’s goals.

To rapidly create common statistical graphics, check out Vega-Lite, a higher-level language built on top of Vega. Not that into JavaScript? Take a look at the Altair Python API for Vega-Lite.

      Vega-Lite API 






A JavaScript API for creating Vega-Lite JSON specifications. Vega-Lite is a high-level grammar for visual analysis that generates complete Vega specifications.

With the Vega-Lite API, you can write JavaScript code like this:

vl.markBar().data('data/movies.json').encode(
  vl.x().fieldQ('IMDB_Rating').bin(true),
  vl.y().count()
)


To produce Vega-Lite JSON like this:

{
  "mark": "bar",
  "data": {"url": "data/movies.json"},
  "encoding": {
    "x": {
      "bin": true,
      "field": "IMDB_Rating",
      "type": "quantitative"
    },
    "y": {
      "aggregate": "count",
      "type": "quantitative"
    }
  }
}


To get started with the Vega-Lite API, see these Observable notebooks:


  Introduction to Vega-Lite

  Vega-Lite API Collection


Build Instructions

For a basic setup allowing you to build the API and run tests:


  Clone https://github.com/vega/vega-lite-api.
  Run yarn to install dependencies for all packages. If you don’t have yarn installed, see https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install.
  Once installation is complete, run yarn build to build the API generator and generate API source code in the src directory. Run yarn test to additionally run the test suite.

    Introduction to Vega-Lite
    This tutorial will guide through the process of writing a visualization specification in Vega-Lite. We will walk you through all main components of Vega-Lite by adding each of them to an example specification one-by-one. After creating the example visualization, we will also guide you how to embed the final visualization on a web page.

We suggest that you follow along the tutorial by building a visualization in the online editor. Extend your specification in the editor as you read through this tutorial. If something does not work as expected, compare your specifications with ones inside this tutorial.

The Data

Let’s say you have a tabular data set with a categorical variable in the first column a and a numerical variable in the second column b.


  
    
      a
      b
    
  
  
    
      C
      2
    
    
      C
      7
    
    
      C
      4
    
    
      D
      1
    
    
      D
      2
    
    
      D
      6
    
    
      E
      8
    
    
      E
      4
    
    
      E
      7
    
  


We can represent this data as a JSON array in which each row is an object in the array.

[
  {"a": "C", "b": 2},
  {"a": "C", "b": 7},
  {"a": "C", "b": 4},
  {"a": "D", "b": 1},
  {"a": "D", "b": 2},
  {"a": "D", "b": 6},
  {"a": "E", "b": 8},
  {"a": "E", "b": 4},
  {"a": "E", "b": 7}
]


To visualize this data with Vega-Lite, we can add it directly to the data property in a Vega-Lite specification.

{
  "data": {
    "values": [
      {"a": "C", "b": 2},
      {"a": "C", "b": 7},
      {"a": "C", "b": 4},
      {"a": "D", "b": 1},
      {"a": "D", "b": 2},
      {"a": "D", "b": 6},
      {"a": "E", "b": 8},
      {"a": "E", "b": 4},
      {"a": "E", "b": 7}
    ]
  }
}


The data property defines the data source of the visualization. In this example, we embed the data inline by directly setting values property. Vega-Lite also supports other types of data sources besides inline data.

Encoding Data with Marks

Now we have a data source but we haven’t defined yet how the data should be visualized.

Basic graphical elements in Vega-Lite are marks. Marks provide basic shapes whose properties (such as position, size, and color) can be used to visually encode data, either from a data field (or a variable), or a constant value.

To show the data as a point, we can set the mark property to point.



Now, it looks like we get a point. In fact, Vega-Lite renders one point for each object in the array, but they are all overlapping since we have not specified each point’s position.

To visually separate the points, data variables can be mapped to visual properties of a mark. For example, we can encode the variable a of the data with x channel, which represents the x-position of the points. We can do that by adding an encoding object with its key x mapped to a channel definition that describes variable a.

...
"encoding": {
  "x": {"field": "a", "type": "nominal"}
}
...




The encoding object is a key-value mapping between encoding channels (such as x, y) and definitions of the mapped data fields. The channel definition describes the field’s name (field) and its data type (type). In this example, we map the values for field a to the encoding channel x (the x-location of the points) and set a’s data type to nominal, since it represents categories. (See the documentation for more information about data types.)

In the visualization above, Vega-Lite automatically adds an axis with labels for the different categories as well as an axis title. However, 3 points in each category are still overlapping. So far, we have only defined a visual encoding for the field a. We can also map the field b to the y channel.

...
"y": {"field": "b", "type": "quantitative"}
...


This time we set the field type to be quantitative because the values in field b are numeric.



Now we can see the raw data points. Note that Vega-Lite automatically adds grid lines to the y-axis to facilitate comparison of the b values.

Data Transformation: Aggregation

Vega-Lite also supports data transformation such as aggregation. By adding "aggregate": "average" to the definition of the y channel, we can see the average value of a in each category. For example, the average value of category D is (1 + 2 + 6)/3 = 9/3 = 3.



Great! You computed the aggregate values for each category and visualized the resulting value as a point. Typically aggregated values for categories are visualized using bar charts. To create a bar chart, we have to change the mark type from point to bar.

- "mark": "point"
+ "mark": "bar"




Since the quantitative value is on y, you automatically get a vertical bar chart. If we swap the x and y channel, we get a horizontal bar chart instead.



Customize your Visualization



Vega-Lite automatically provides default properties for the visualization. You can further customize these values by adding more properties. For example, to change the title of the x-axis from Average of b to Mean of b, we can set the title property of the axis in the x channel.



Publish your Visualization Online

You have learned about basic components of a Vega-Lite specification. Now, let’s see how to publish your visualization.

You can use Vega-Embed to embed your Vega-Lite visualization in a webpage. For example, you can create a web page with the following content:

<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Vega-Lite Bar Chart</title>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />

    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega-embed@6.29.0"></script>

    <style media="screen">
      /* Add space between Vega-Embed links  */
      .vega-actions a {
        margin-right: 5px;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>

      // Embed the visualization in the container with id `vis`
      vegaEmbed('#vis', vlSpec);

  </body>
</html>


In this webpage, we first load the dependencies for Vega-Lite (Vega-Embed, Vega, and Vega-Lite) in the <head/> tag of the document. We also create an HTML <div/> element with id vis to serve as a container for the visualization.

In the JavaScript code, we create a variable vlSpec that holds the Vega-Lite specification in JSON format. The vegaEmbed method translates a Vega-Lite specification into a Vega specification and then calls the Vega Runtime to display visualization in the container <div/> element.

If viewed in a browser, this page displays our bar chart like on our demo page. You can also fork our Vega-Lite Block example.

The Data

Let’s say you have a tabular data set with a categorical variable in the first column a and a numerical variable in the second column b.


  
    
      a
      b
    
  
  
    
      C
      2
    
    
      C
      7
    
    
      C
      4
    
    
      D
      1
    
    
      D
      2
    
    
      D
      6
    
    
      E
      8
    
    
      E
      4
    
    
      E
      7
    
  


We can represent this data as a JSON array in which each row is an object in the array.

[
  {"a": "C", "b": 2},
  {"a": "C", "b": 7},
  {"a": "C", "b": 4},
  {"a": "D", "b": 1},
  {"a": "D", "b": 2},
  {"a": "D", "b": 6},
  {"a": "E", "b": 8},
  {"a": "E", "b": 4},
  {"a": "E", "b": 7}
]


To visualize this data with Vega-Lite, we can add it directly to the data property in a Vega-Lite specification.

{
  "data": {
    "values": [
      {"a": "C", "b": 2},
      {"a": "C", "b": 7},
      {"a": "C", "b": 4},
      {"a": "D", "b": 1},
      {"a": "D", "b": 2},
      {"a": "D", "b": 6},
      {"a": "E", "b": 8},
      {"a": "E", "b": 4},
      {"a": "E", "b": 7}
    ]
  }
}


The data property defines the data source of the visualization. In this example, we embed the data inline by directly setting values property. Vega-Lite also supports other types of data sources besides inline data.

Encoding Data with Marks

Now we have a data source but we haven’t defined yet how the data should be visualized.

Basic graphical elements in Vega-Lite are marks. Marks provide basic shapes whose properties (such as position, size, and color) can be used to visually encode data, either from a data field (or a variable), or a constant value.

To show the data as a point, we can set the mark property to point.



Now, it looks like we get a point. In fact, Vega-Lite renders one point for each object in the array, but they are all overlapping since we have not specified each point’s position.

To visually separate the points, data variables can be mapped to visual properties of a mark. For example, we can encode the variable a of the data with x channel, which represents the x-position of the points. We can do that by adding an encoding object with its key x mapped to a channel definition that describes variable a.

...
"encoding": {
  "x": {"field": "a", "type": "nominal"}
}
...




The encoding object is a key-value mapping between encoding channels (such as x, y) and definitions of the mapped data fields. The channel definition describes the field’s name (field) and its data type (type). In this example, we map the values for field a to the encoding channel x (the x-location of the points) and set a’s data type to nominal, since it represents categories. (See the documentation for more information about data types.)

In the visualization above, Vega-Lite automatically adds an axis with labels for the different categories as well as an axis title. However, 3 points in each category are still overlapping. So far, we have only defined a visual encoding for the field a. We can also map the field b to the y channel.

...
"y": {"field": "b", "type": "quantitative"}
...


This time we set the field type to be quantitative because the values in field b are numeric.



Now we can see the raw data points. Note that Vega-Lite automatically adds grid lines to the y-axis to facilitate comparison of the b values.

Data Transformation: Aggregation

Vega-Lite also supports data transformation such as aggregation. By adding "aggregate": "average" to the definition of the y channel, we can see the average value of a in each category. For example, the average value of category D is (1 + 2 + 6)/3 = 9/3 = 3.



Great! You computed the aggregate values for each category and visualized the resulting value as a point. Typically aggregated values for categories are visualized using bar charts. To create a bar chart, we have to change the mark type from point to bar.

- "mark": "point"
+ "mark": "bar"




Since the quantitative value is on y, you automatically get a vertical bar chart. If we swap the x and y channel, we get a horizontal bar chart instead.



Customize your Visualization



Vega-Lite automatically provides default properties for the visualization. You can further customize these values by adding more properties. For example, to change the title of the x-axis from Average of b to Mean of b, we can set the title property of the axis in the x channel.



Publish your Visualization Online

You have learned about basic components of a Vega-Lite specification. Now, let’s see how to publish your visualization.

You can use Vega-Embed to embed your Vega-Lite visualization in a webpage. For example, you can create a web page with the following content:

<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Vega-Lite Bar Chart</title>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />

    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega@6.0.0"></script>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega-lite@6.1.0"></script>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega-embed@6.29.0"></script>

    <style media="screen">
      /* Add space between Vega-Embed links  */
      .vega-actions a {
        margin-right: 5px;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Template for Embedding Vega-Lite Visualization</h1>
    <!-- Container for the visualization -->
    <div id="vis"></div>

    <script>
      // Assign the specification to a local variable vlSpec.
      var vlSpec = {
        $schema: 'https://vega.github.io/schema/vega-lite/v6.json',
        data: {
          values: [
            {a: 'C', b: 2},
            {a: 'C', b: 7},
            {a: 'C', b: 4},
            {a: 'D', b: 1},
            {a: 'D', b: 2},
            {a: 'D', b: 6},
            {a: 'E', b: 8},
            {a: 'E', b: 4},
            {a: 'E', b: 7},
          ],
        },
        mark: 'bar',
        encoding: {
          y: {field: 'a', type: 'nominal'},
          x: {
            aggregate: 'average',
            field: 'b',
            type: 'quantitative',
            axis: {
              title: 'Average of b',
            },
          },
        },
      };

      // Embed the visualization in the container with id `vis`
      vegaEmbed('#vis', vlSpec);
    </script>
  </body>
</html>


In this webpage, we first load the dependencies for Vega-Lite (Vega-Embed, Vega, and Vega-Lite) in the <head/> tag of the document. We also create an HTML <div/> element with id vis to serve as a container for the visualization.

In the JavaScript code, we create a variable vlSpec that holds the Vega-Lite specification in JSON format. The vegaEmbed method translates a Vega-Lite specification into a Vega specification and then calls the Vega Runtime to display visualization in the container <div/> element.

If viewed in a browser, this page displays our bar chart like on our demo page. You can also fork our Vega-Lite Block example.

    Overview
    
  Edit this page

Vega-Lite is a high-level grammar for interactive graphics. It provides a concise JSON syntax for supporting rapid generation of interactive multi-view visualizations to support analysis. Vega-Lite can serve as a declarative format for describing and creating data visualizations. To use Vega-Lite, our compiler compiles a Vega-Lite specification into a lower-level, more detailed Vega specifications and rendered using Vega’s compiler.

This documentation describes the JSON specification language and how to use Vega-Lite visualizations in a web application.

Vega-Lite is a high-level grammar for interactive graphics. It provides a concise JSON syntax for supporting rapid generation of interactive multi-view visualizations to support analysis. Vega-Lite can serve as a declarative format for describing and creating data visualizations. To use Vega-Lite, our compiler compiles a Vega-Lite specification into a lower-level, more detailed Vega specifications and rendered using Vega’s compiler.

This documentation describes the JSON specification language and how to use Vega-Lite visualizations in a web application.

    Embedding Vega-Lite
    Fork our Vega-Lite Block if you want to quickly publish a Vega-Lite visualization on the web.

The easiest way to use Vega-Lite on your own web page is with Vega-Embed, a library we built to make the process as painless as possible.

Get Vega-Lite and other dependencies

To embed a Vega-Lite specification on your web page first load the required libraries. You can get Vega, Vega-Lite, and Vega-Embed via a CDN, NPM, or manually download them.

CDN

For production deployments you will likely want to serve your own files or use a content delivery network (CDN). Vega-Lite releases are hosted on jsDelivr:

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega@6.0.0"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega-lite@6.1.0"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega-embed@6.29.0"></script>


If you want to automatically use the latest versions of Vega-Lite, Vega, and Vega-Embed, you can specify only the major version.

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega@6"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega-lite@6"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega-embed@6"></script>


NPM

If you prefer to host the dependencies yourself, we suggest that you use npm to install the libraries (Vega, Vega-Lite, and Vega-Embed) to get the latest stable version. To install with npm, simply install it as you would any other npm module.

npm install vega
npm install vega-lite
npm install vega-embed


You can learn more about NPM on the official website.

Download

Alternatively, you can download the latest Vega-Lite release and add it to your project manually. In this case, you will also have to download Vega, and Vega-Embed.

Start using Vega-Lite with Vega-Embed

The next step after getting the libraries is to create a DOM element that the visualization will be attached to.

<div id="vis"></div>


Then use Vega-Embed’s provided function to embed your spec.

// More argument info at https://github.com/vega/vega-embed
vegaEmbed('#vis', yourVlSpec);


Vega-Embed automatically adds links to export an image, view the source, and open the specification in the online editor. These links can be individually disabled. For more information, read the Vega-Embed documentation.

Here is the final HTML file in the easiest way to embed Vega-Lite (assuming that you use the CDN approach from above). See the output in your browser.

  Line Chart with Stroked Point Markers
   By setting the point property of the line mark definition to an object defining a property of the overlaying point marks, we can overlay point markers on top of line. Here we create stroked points by setting their "filled" to false and their fill to "white".

Notes: (1) This is equivalent to adding another layer of point marks. 
 (2) While "point" marks are normally semi-transparent, the overlay point marker has opacity = 1 by default.

  Becker's Barley Trellis Plot
   The Trellis display by Becker et al. helped establish small multiples as a “powerful mechanism for understanding interactions in studies of how a response depends on explanatory variables”. Here we reproduce a trellis of Barley yields from the 1930s, complete with main-effects ordering to facilitate comparison.

  Bar Chart Highlighting Values beyond a Threshold
   To create a bar chart that highlights values beyond a threshold, we use two layers of bar marks. The lower layer shows all the bars while the upper layer shows bar with values above the threshold in red (#e45755).  We then layer a rule mark and a text mark over the bars to annotate the threshold value.

   To create a bar chart that highlights values beyond a threshold, we use two layers of bar marks. The lower layer shows all the bars while the upper layer shows bar with values above the threshold in red (#e45755).  We then layer a rule mark and a text mark over the bars to annotate the threshold value.

    Vega – A Visualization Grammar
  






  
    Vega is a visualization grammar, a declarative language for creating, saving, and sharing interactive visualization designs. With Vega, you can describe the visual appearance and interactive behavior of a visualization in a JSON format, and generate web-based views using Canvas or SVG.

Version 5.31.0

Vega provides basic building blocks for a wide variety of visualization designs: data loading and transformation, scales, map projections, axes, legends, and graphical marks such as rectangles, lines, plotting symbols, etc. Interaction techniques can be specified using reactive signals that dynamically modify a visualization in response to input event streams.

A Vega specification defines an interactive visualization in a JSON format. Specifications are parsed by Vega’s JavaScript runtime to generate both static images or interactive web-based views. Vega provides a convenient representation for computational generation of visualizations, and can serve as a foundation for new APIs and visual analysis tools.

To get started with Vega, take a look at the tutorials, example gallery, and usage guide, or read about the project’s goals.

To rapidly create common statistical graphics, check out Vega-Lite, a higher-level language built on top of Vega. Not that into JavaScript? Take a look at the Altair Python API for Vega-Lite.

    About the Vega Project
    Over years working in data visualization, we’ve sought to build tools that help designers craft sophisticated graphics, including systems such as Prefuse, Protovis and D3.js. However, in the grand scheme of things, “artisanal” visualizations hand-coded by skilled designers are the exception, not the rule. The vast majority of the world’s visualizations instead are produced using end-user applications such as spreadsheets and business intelligence tools. While valuable, these tools often fall short of fully supporting the iterative, interactive process of data analysis. Improved tools could help a larger swath of people create effective visualizations and better understand their data.

The goal of the Vega project is to promote an ecosystem of usable and interoperable tools, supporting use cases ranging from exploratory data analysis to effective communication via custom visualization design.

This goal has led us to develop not a singular system, but rather a stack of tools for interactive data visualization. At the foundation of this stack is the Vega visualization grammar. Similar in spirit to how SQL provides a language for expressing database queries, Vega provides a declarative language for describing visualizations. Vega specifications include the data transformations and visual encoding rules needed to express a rich space of visualizations. Building on libraries such as D3, the Vega runtime parses specifications in a JSON format to produce interactive web-based graphics. One unique aspect of Vega is its support for declarative interaction design: instead of the “spaghetti code” of event handler callbacks, Vega treats user input (mouse movement, touch events, etc.) as first-class streaming data to drive reactive updates to a visualization.

While Vega is useful in its own right (for example, Vega is deployed on Wikipedia to define visualizations directly within wiki pages), our primary motivation is for Vega to serve as a foundation for higher-level tools. Vega provides a formal language and computational file format for representing and reasoning about visualizations. In other words, Vega provides a more convenient yet powerful means for writing programs that generate visualizations, ranging from interactive design tools to automatic chart recommendation tools. Vega provides a performant runtime and can serve as an “assembly language” for visualization, letting other tools focus on design questions rather than low-level implementation details.

    Documentation
    The Vega visualization grammar provides basic building blocks for a wide variety of visualization designs. This page provides documentation of Vega JSON specifications and JavaScript API.

To start learning Vega, we recommend first working through the introductory Let’s Make A Bar Chart tutorial and exploring the example gallery, then digging into the documentation. These pages document Vega version 3.0 and later; if you are familiar with Vega 2.x, you might begin with the Vega 2 porting guide.

Specification Reference

A Vega specification is a JSON object that describes an interactive visualization design. A specification consists of basic properties (such as the width and height of the view) and definitions for the data to visualize, scales that map data values to visual values, axes and legends that visualize these scales, cartographic projections for drawing maps, graphical marks such as rectangles, lines, and symbols to visually represent data, and signals to process user input and modify the visualization in response.

    Usage
    Vega can be deployed for interactive visualizations within a web browser, or to render static PNG and SVG images server-side. This page describes the various means of deployment and use.

Usage Reference


  Web Deployment
    
      Import Vega JavaScript
      Using the Vega View API
      Using the Vega-Embed Module
      Supporting Internet Explorer
      Content Security Policy
    
  
  Command Line Utilities
  Server-Side Deployment


Web Deployment

To deploy Vega on the web, first import the requisite JavaScript libraries. Then, use the Vega View API or the convenient Vega-Embed helper module to parse Vega specifications and add interactive visualizations to a web page.

Try Vega with Vega-Embed online and publish your own chart by forking our example Block.

Import Vega JavaScript

To use Vega on a web page you first need to load the Vega JavaScript files. The simplest option is to import the complete Vega bundle.

<head>
  <script src="https://vega.github.io/vega/vega.min.js"></script>
</head>


Loading Vega from a CDN. While the example above loads files from the Vega web site, for production deployments you will likely want to serve your own files or use a content delivery network (CDN). Vega releases are hosted on jsDelivr:

<head>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega@5"></script>
</head>


Using Vega and D3 together. The full vega.js and vega.min.js files bundle up all dependencies, including d3 modules and topojson-client. If you plan to independently use d3.js on your page, you can use a smaller Vega bundle that excludes redundant d3 files. Import d3 first, then import the smaller vega-core.min.js file to reduce the total file size. If you plan to load TopoJSON data files, you’ll need to import the topojson-client package as well.

<head>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@7"></script>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/topojson-client@3"></script>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega@5/build/vega-core.min.js"></script>
</head>


Using Vega with a bundler. If you use Vega with a bundler like rollup.js, you can import Vega as a module.

import * as vega from "vega";

Using the Vega-Embed Module

The Vega-Embed module provides a convenient method for adding either Vega or Vega-Lite visualizations to a web page. This module will take care of steps such as loading specification files from a URL and generating views with standard configuration options. In addition, you can include accompanying links to export images and view source. For more, see the Vega-Embed repository.

<head>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega@5"></script>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega-lite@5"></script>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega-embed@6"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="view"></div>
  <script>
    vegaEmbed(
      '#view',
      'https://vega.github.io/vega/examples/bar-chart.vg.json'
    );
  </script>
</body>


Back to reference

Using the Vega View API

Vega’s View component takes a parsed specification and configuration options as input and sets up an interactive web component. The View API also provides methods for streaming data updates, exporting static images, and accessing internal data for debugging purposes. For more, see the View component documentation.

<head>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega@5"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="view"></div>
  <script type="text/javascript">
    var view;

    fetch('https://vega.github.io/vega/examples/bar-chart.vg.json')
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(spec => render(spec))
      .catch(err => console.error(err));

    function render(spec) {
      view = new vega.View(vega.parse(spec), {
        renderer:  'canvas',  // renderer (canvas or svg)
        container: '#view',   // parent DOM container
        hover:     true       // enable hover processing
      });
      return view.runAsync();
    }
  </script>
</body>


Vega visualizations will be added to a parent DOM container element. This element (either a DOM object or a unique CSS selector string) must be provided  as a View constructor option or an as argument to the View initialize method. Note: Any existing content within the parent container element will be removed upon view initialization.

Vega and Content Security Policy (CSP)

By default Vega is not compliant with standard Content Security Policy (CSP), as it uses the Function constructor to generate functions defined in the Vega expression language. However, Vega allows use of alternative expression evaluators that are CSP-compliant. For more, see the expression interpreter usage documentation.

Back to reference

Command Line Utilities

The vega-cli package includes three node.js-based command line utilities – vg2pdf, vg2png, and vg2svg – for rendering static visualization images. These commands render to PDF, PNG, or SVG files, respectively.


  vg2pdf: vg2pdf [options] [input_vega_json_file] [output_pdf_file]
  vg2png: vg2png [options] [input_vega_json_file] [output_png_file]
  vg2svg: vg2svg [options] [input_vega_json_file] [output_svg_file]


If no input Vega JSON file is given, the utilities will attempt to read the file from standard input. If no output file is given, the resulting PDF, PNG, or SVG data will be written to standard output, and so can be piped into other applications.

The programs also accept the following (optional) parameters:


  -b, –base - [String] A base directory to use for data and image loading. For web retrieval, use -b http://host/data/. For files, use -b data/ (relative path) or -b file:///dir/data/ (absolute path).
  -h, –header - [Flag] Includes XML header and DOCTYPE in SVG output (vg2svg only).
  -s, –scale - [Number] [Default:1] A resolution scale factor. For example, -s 2 results in a doubling of the output resolution. For PDF or SVG, scales the output coordinate space.
  -seed, - [Number] Seed for random number generation. Allows for consistent output over random values. Internally replaces Math.random with a linear congruential generator.
  -c, –config, - [String] Provide a Vega config object. A file path string to a JSON file or .js file that exports an object.
  -f, –format, - [String] Set the number format locale. A file path string to a JSON file or .js file that exports an object.
  -t, –timeFormat, - [String] Set data/time format locale. A file path string to a JSON file or .js file that exports an object.
  -l, –loglevel - [String] Level of log messages written to standard error output. One of error, warn (default), info, or debug.
  –help - [Flag] Print usage help to the console.


To install the command line utilities, you must install the vega-cli npm package. For example, yarn global add vega-cli or npm install -g vega-cli will install the utilities for global use. If you install the package locally, the commands are accessible via your node_modules folder (./node_modules/bin/vg2png). The command line utilities depend on the node-canvas package. See below for more information about Vega and node-canvas.

All errors and logging message will be written to standard error output (stderr). To create a log file, pipe the stderr output to the desired file. For example: vg2pdf ...arguments 2> vg2pdf.log.

Examples

In the vega package, you can run the following from the command line if vega-cli is installed.

Render the bar chart example to a PNG file:

vg2png test/specs-valid/bar.vg.json bar.png


Render the bar chart example to an SVG file, including XML headers:

vg2svg -h test/specs-valid/bar.vg.json bar.svg


Render the arc example as a PDF, piped to a file via standard output:

vg2pdf test/specs-valid/arc.vg.json > arc.pdf


Render the choropleth example to a PNG file. A base directory is specified for loading data files:

vg2png -b test test/specs-valid/choropleth.vg.json > choropleth.png


Render the bar chart example to a PNG file at double resolution:

vg2png -s 2 test/specs-valid/bar.vg.json bar.png

Server-Side Deployment using Node.js

To use Vega as a component within a larger project, first install it either directly (yarn add vega or npm install vega) or by including "vega" among the dependencies in your package.json file. In node.js JavaScript code, import Vega using require('vega'). Much like browser-based deployments, Node.js deployments leverage the Vega View API. However, server-side View instances should use the renderer type none and provide no DOM element to the initialize method.

To generate PNG images and accurately measure font metrics for text mark truncation, the node-canvas package must be installed. The vega package does not require node-canvas by default, so you must include it as an explicit dependency in your own project if you wish to use it. The vega-cli package, on the other hand, does include node-canvas as an explicit dependency.

Occasionally some system configurations may run into errors while installing node-canvas. Please consult the node-canvas documentation if you experience installation issues.

Example

var vega = require('vega');

// create a new view instance for a given Vega JSON spec
var view = new vega.View(vega.parse(spec), {renderer: 'none'});

// generate a static SVG image
view.toSVG()
  .then(function(svg) {
    // process svg string
  })
  .catch(function(err) { console.error(err); });

// generate a static PNG image
view.toCanvas()
  .then(function(canvas) {
    // process node-canvas instance
    // for example, generate a PNG stream to write
    var stream = canvas.createPNGStream();
  })
  .catch(function(err) { console.error(err); });

The Vega-Embed module provides a convenient method for adding either Vega or Vega-Lite visualizations to a web page. This module will take care of steps such as loading specification files from a URL and generating views with standard configuration options. In addition, you can include accompanying links to export images and view source. For more, see the Vega-Embed repository.

Using the Vega View API

Vega’s View component takes a parsed specification and configuration options as input and sets up an interactive web component. The View API also provides methods for streaming data updates, exporting static images, and accessing internal data for debugging purposes. For more, see the View component documentation.

<head>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega@5"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="view"></div>
  <script type="text/javascript">
    var view;

    fetch('https://vega.github.io/vega/examples/bar-chart.vg.json')
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(spec => render(spec))
      .catch(err => console.error(err));

    function render(spec) {
      view = new vega.View(vega.parse(spec), {
        renderer:  'canvas',  // renderer (canvas or svg)
        container: '#view',   // parent DOM container
        hover:     true       // enable hover processing
      });
      return view.runAsync();
    }
  </script>
</body>


Vega visualizations will be added to a parent DOM container element. This element (either a DOM object or a unique CSS selector string) must be provided  as a View constructor option or an as argument to the View initialize method. Note: Any existing content within the parent container element will be removed upon view initialization.

Vega and Content Security Policy (CSP)

By default Vega is not compliant with standard Content Security Policy (CSP), as it uses the Function constructor to generate functions defined in the Vega expression language. However, Vega allows use of alternative expression evaluators that are CSP-compliant. For more, see the expression interpreter usage documentation.

Command Line Utilities

The vega-cli package includes three node.js-based command line utilities – vg2pdf, vg2png, and vg2svg – for rendering static visualization images. These commands render to PDF, PNG, or SVG files, respectively.


  vg2pdf: vg2pdf [options] [input_vega_json_file] [output_pdf_file]
  vg2png: vg2png [options] [input_vega_json_file] [output_png_file]
  vg2svg: vg2svg [options] [input_vega_json_file] [output_svg_file]


If no input Vega JSON file is given, the utilities will attempt to read the file from standard input. If no output file is given, the resulting PDF, PNG, or SVG data will be written to standard output, and so can be piped into other applications.

The programs also accept the following (optional) parameters:


  -b, –base - [String] A base directory to use for data and image loading. For web retrieval, use -b http://host/data/. For files, use -b data/ (relative path) or -b file:///dir/data/ (absolute path).
  -h, –header - [Flag] Includes XML header and DOCTYPE in SVG output (vg2svg only).
  -s, –scale - [Number] [Default:1] A resolution scale factor. For example, -s 2 results in a doubling of the output resolution. For PDF or SVG, scales the output coordinate space.
  -seed, - [Number] Seed for random number generation. Allows for consistent output over random values. Internally replaces Math.random with a linear congruential generator.
  -c, –config, - [String] Provide a Vega config object. A file path string to a JSON file or .js file that exports an object.
  -f, –format, - [String] Set the number format locale. A file path string to a JSON file or .js file that exports an object.
  -t, –timeFormat, - [String] Set data/time format locale. A file path string to a JSON file or .js file that exports an object.
  -l, –loglevel - [String] Level of log messages written to standard error output. One of error, warn (default), info, or debug.
  –help - [Flag] Print usage help to the console.


To install the command line utilities, you must install the vega-cli npm package. For example, yarn global add vega-cli or npm install -g vega-cli will install the utilities for global use. If you install the package locally, the commands are accessible via your node_modules folder (./node_modules/bin/vg2png). The command line utilities depend on the node-canvas package. See below for more information about Vega and node-canvas.

All errors and logging message will be written to standard error output (stderr). To create a log file, pipe the stderr output to the desired file. For example: vg2pdf ...arguments 2> vg2pdf.log.

Examples

In the vega package, you can run the following from the command line if vega-cli is installed.

Render the bar chart example to a PNG file:

vg2png test/specs-valid/bar.vg.json bar.png


Render the bar chart example to an SVG file, including XML headers:

vg2svg -h test/specs-valid/bar.vg.json bar.svg


Render the arc example as a PDF, piped to a file via standard output:

vg2pdf test/specs-valid/arc.vg.json > arc.pdf


Render the choropleth example to a PNG file. A base directory is specified for loading data files:

vg2png -b test test/specs-valid/choropleth.vg.json > choropleth.png


Render the bar chart example to a PNG file at double resolution:

vg2png -s 2 test/specs-valid/bar.vg.json bar.png

Server-Side Deployment using Node.js

To use Vega as a component within a larger project, first install it either directly (yarn add vega or npm install vega) or by including "vega" among the dependencies in your package.json file. In node.js JavaScript code, import Vega using require('vega'). Much like browser-based deployments, Node.js deployments leverage the Vega View API. However, server-side View instances should use the renderer type none and provide no DOM element to the initialize method.

To generate PNG images and accurately measure font metrics for text mark truncation, the node-canvas package must be installed. The vega package does not require node-canvas by default, so you must include it as an explicit dependency in your own project if you wish to use it. The vega-cli package, on the other hand, does include node-canvas as an explicit dependency.

Occasionally some system configurations may run into errors while installing node-canvas. Please consult the node-canvas documentation if you experience installation issues.

Example

var vega = require('vega');

// create a new view instance for a given Vega JSON spec
var view = new vega.View(vega.parse(spec), {renderer: 'none'});

// generate a static SVG image
view.toSVG()
  .then(function(svg) {
    // process svg string
  })
  .catch(function(err) { console.error(err); });

// generate a static PNG image
view.toCanvas()
  .then(function(canvas) {
    // process node-canvas instance
    // for example, generate a PNG stream to write
    var stream = canvas.createPNGStream();
  })
  .catch(function(err) { console.error(err); });

    Data
    Data set definitions and transforms define the data to load and how to process it.

The basic data model used by Vega is tabular data, similar to a spreadsheet or database table. Individual data sets are assumed to contain a collection of records (or “rows”), which may contain any number of named data attributes (fields, or “columns”). Records are modeled using standard JavaScript objects.

If the input data is simply an array of primitive values, Vega maps each value to the data property of a new object. For example [5, 3, 8, 1] is loaded as:

[ {"data": 5}, {"data": 3}, {"data": 8}, {"data": 1} ]


Upon ingest, Vega also assigns each data object a unique id property, accessible via a custom Symbol. As a result, the id property is not accessible via a string key and is not enumerable, though you can observe the id value when inspecting data objects in a JavaScript console.

Data sets can be specified directly by defining data inline or providing a URL from which to load the data. Alternatively, data can be bound dynamically at runtime by using the View API to provide data when a chart is instantiated or issue streaming updates. Loading data from a URL will be subject to the policies of your runtime environment (e.g., cross-origin request rules).

Documentation Overview


  Data Properties
  Data Formats
  Examples


Data Properties

Properties for specifying a data set. At most one of the source, url, or values properties should be defined.


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      name
      String
      Required. A unique name for the data set.
    
    
      format
      Format
      An object that specifies the format for parsing the data file or values. See the format reference for more.
    
    
      source
      String | String[ ]
      The name of one or more data sets to use as the source for this data set. The source property is useful in combination with a transform pipeline to derive new data. If string-valued, indicates the name of the source data set. If array-valued, specifies a collection of data source names that should be merged (unioned) together.
    
    
      url
      String
      A URL from which to load the data set. Use the format property to ensure the loaded data is correctly parsed. If the format property is not specified, the data is assumed to be in a row-oriented JSON format.
    
    
      values
      Any
      The full data set, included inline. The values property allows data to be included directly within the specification itself. While most commonly an array of objects, other data types (such as CSV strings) may be used, subject to the format settings.
    
    
      async
      Boolean
      ≥ 5.9 A boolean flag (default false) indicating if dynamic data loading or reformatting should occur asynchronously. If true, dataflow evaluation will complete, data loading will occur in the background, and the dataflow will be re-evaluated when loading is complete. If false, dataflow evaluation will block until loading is complete and then continue within the same evaluation cycle. The use of async can allow multiple dynamic datasets to be loaded simultaneously while still supporting interactivity. However, the use of async can cause datasets to remain empty while the rest of the dataflow is evaluated, potentially affecting downstream computation.
    
    
      on
      Trigger[ ]
      An array of updates to insert, remove, & toggle data values, or clear the data when trigger conditions are met. See the trigger reference for more.
    
    
      transform
      Transform[ ]

≥ 4.2 For Vega version 4.2 and higher, the data url parameter and (when used with URL-loading) the format parameter may include signal references. This feature allows either the source url or one or more formatting parameters to be dynamically changed at runtime, causing the data to be reloaded. For example, a single spec might load a different dataset based on user input, or the data might be polled at a regular interval in conjunction with a timer event stream.

If no signals are used (the traditional configuration), external data sources are loaded immediately upon view construction and the first dataflow evaluation is delayed until data loading is complete. For dynamic loading, the dataflow must first be evaluated in order to determine the signal values, and then data can be loaded. As a result of this, downstream transforms and encodings may initially be evaluated with empty datasets: be sure any signal expressions behave appropriately with empty data, including downstream concerns such as empty scale domains.

Format

The format object describes the data format and additional parsing instructions.


  
    
      Name
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      type
      String
      The data format type. The currently supported data formats are json (the default), csv (comma-separated values), tsv (tab-separated values), dsv (delimited text files), and topojson.
    
    
      parse
      String | Object
      If set to auto, perform automatic type inference to determine the desired data types. Alternatively, a parsing directive object can be provided for explicit data types. Each property of the object corresponds to a field name, and the value to the desired data type (one of "boolean", "date", "number" or "string"). For example, "parse": {"modified_on": "date"} parses the modified_on field in each input record as a Date value. Specific date formats can be provided (e.g., {"foo": "date:'%m%d%Y'"}), using the d3-time-format syntax. UTC date format parsing is supported similarly (e.g., {"foo": "utc:'%m%d%Y'"}).
    
  


json

Loads a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file. Assumes row-oriented data, where each row is an object with named attributes. This is the default file format, and so will be used if no format parameter is provided. If specified, the format parameter should have a type property of "json", and can also accept the following:


  
    
      Name
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      property
      String
      The JSON property containing the desired data. This parameter can be used when the loaded JSON file may have surrounding structure or meta-data. For example "property": "values.features" is equivalent to retrieving json.values.features from the loaded JSON object.
    
    
      copy
      Boolean
      A boolean flag (default false) that indicates if input JSON data should be copied prior to use. This setting may be useful when providing as input pre-parsed JSON data (e.g., not loaded from a URL) that should not be modified.
    
  


csv

Load a comma-separated values (CSV) file.


  
    
      Name
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      header
      String[ ]
      An array of field names to prepend to the data as a header row. A header should only be supplied if the input data does not already include one.
    
  


tsv

Load a tab-separated values (TSV) file.


  
    
      Name
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      header
      String[ ]
      An array of field names to prepend to the data as a header row. A header should only be supplied if the input data does not already include one.
    
  


dsv

Load a delimited text file with a custom delimiter.


  
    
      Name
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      delimiter
      String
      Required. The delimiter between records. The delimiter must be a single character (i.e., a single 16-bit code unit); so, ASCII delimiters are fine, but emoji delimiters are not.
    
    
      header
      String[ ]
      An array of field names to prepend to the data as a header row. A header should only be supplied if the input data does not already include one.
    
  


topojson

Load a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file using the TopoJSON format. The input file must contain valid TopoJSON data. The TopoJSON input is then converted into a GeoJSON format for use within Vega. There are two mutually exclusive properties that can be used to specify the conversion process:


  
    
      Name
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      feature
      String
      The name of the TopoJSON object set to convert to a GeoJSON feature collection. For example, in a map of the world, there may be an object set named "countries". Using the feature property, we can extract this set and generate a GeoJSON feature object for each country.
    
    
      mesh
      String
      The name of the TopoJSON object set to convert to a mesh. Similar to the feature option, mesh extracts a named TopoJSON object set. Unlike the feature option, the corresponding geo data is returned as a single, unified mesh instance, not as individual GeoJSON features. Extracting a mesh is useful for more efficiently drawing borders or other geographic elements that you do not need to associate with specific regions such as individual countries, states or counties.
    
    
      filter
      String
      An optional filter to apply to an extracted mesh. If set to "interior", only interior region boundaries are included, filtering out exterior borders. If set to "exterior", only the exterior border is included, filtering out all internal boundaries. If null or unspecified (the default), no filtering is performed. This property applies to mesh extraction only, not feature extraction. ≥ 5.4
    
    
      property
      String
      The JSON property containing the desired data. Similar to type=json, this optional parameter can be used when the loaded TopoJSON data has surrounding structure or meta-data.
    
    
      copy
      Boolean
      A boolean flag (default false) that indicates if input JSON data should be copied prior to use. Similar to type=json, this setting may be useful when providing as input pre-parsed JSON data (e.g., not loaded from a URL) that should not be modified.
    
  


Examples

Here is an example defining data directly in a specification:

{"name": "table", "values": [12, 23, 47, 6, 52, 19]}


One can also load data from an external file (in this case, a JSON file):

{"name": "points", "url": "data/points.json"}


Or, one can simply declare the existence of a data set. The data can then be dynamically provided when the visualization is instantiated. See the View API documentation for more.

{"name": "table"}


Finally, one can draw from an existing data set and apply new data transforms. In this case, we create a new data set ("stats") by computing aggregate statistics for groups drawn from the source "table" data set:

{
  "name": "stats",
  "source": "table",
  "transform": [
    {
      "type": "aggregate",
      "groupby": ["x"],
      "ops": ["average", "sum", "min", "max"],
      "fields": ["y", "y", "y", "y"]
    }
  ]

    Data
    Data set definitions and transforms define the data to load and how to process it.

The basic data model used by Vega is tabular data, similar to a spreadsheet or database table. Individual data sets are assumed to contain a collection of records (or “rows”), which may contain any number of named data attributes (fields, or “columns”). Records are modeled using standard JavaScript objects.

If the input data is simply an array of primitive values, Vega maps each value to the data property of a new object. For example [5, 3, 8, 1] is loaded as:

[ {"data": 5}, {"data": 3}, {"data": 8}, {"data": 1} ]


Upon ingest, Vega also assigns each data object a unique id property, accessible via a custom Symbol. As a result, the id property is not accessible via a string key and is not enumerable, though you can observe the id value when inspecting data objects in a JavaScript console.

Data sets can be specified directly by defining data inline or providing a URL from which to load the data. Alternatively, data can be bound dynamically at runtime by using the View API to provide data when a chart is instantiated or issue streaming updates. Loading data from a URL will be subject to the policies of your runtime environment (e.g., cross-origin request rules).

Documentation Overview


  Data Properties
  Data Formats
  Examples


Data Properties

Properties for specifying a data set. At most one of the source, url, or values properties should be defined.


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      name
      String
      Required. A unique name for the data set.
    
    
      format
      Format
      An object that specifies the format for parsing the data file or values. See the format reference for more.
    
    
      source
      String | String[ ]
      The name of one or more data sets to use as the source for this data set. The source property is useful in combination with a transform pipeline to derive new data. If string-valued, indicates the name of the source data set. If array-valued, specifies a collection of data source names that should be merged (unioned) together.
    
    
      url
      String
      A URL from which to load the data set. Use the format property to ensure the loaded data is correctly parsed. If the format property is not specified, the data is assumed to be in a row-oriented JSON format.
    
    
      values
      Any
      The full data set, included inline. The values property allows data to be included directly within the specification itself. While most commonly an array of objects, other data types (such as CSV strings) may be used, subject to the format settings.
    
    
      async
      Boolean
      ≥ 5.9 A boolean flag (default false) indicating if dynamic data loading or reformatting should occur asynchronously. If true, dataflow evaluation will complete, data loading will occur in the background, and the dataflow will be re-evaluated when loading is complete. If false, dataflow evaluation will block until loading is complete and then continue within the same evaluation cycle. The use of async can allow multiple dynamic datasets to be loaded simultaneously while still supporting interactivity. However, the use of async can cause datasets to remain empty while the rest of the dataflow is evaluated, potentially affecting downstream computation.
    
    
      on
      Trigger[ ]
      An array of updates to insert, remove, & toggle data values, or clear the data when trigger conditions are met. See the trigger reference for more.
    
    
      transform
      Transform[ ]
      An array of transforms to perform on the input data. The output of the transform pipeline then becomes the value of this data set. See the transform reference for more.
    
  


Dynamic Data Loading

This feature allows either the source url or one or more formatting parameters to be dynamically changed at runtime, causing the data to be reloaded. For example, a single spec might load a different dataset based on user input, or the data might be polled at a regular interval in conjunction with a timer event stream.

If no signals are used (the traditional configuration), external data sources are loaded immediately upon view construction and the first dataflow evaluation is delayed until data loading is complete. For dynamic loading, the dataflow must first be evaluated in order to determine the signal values, and then data can be loaded. As a result of this, downstream transforms and encodings may initially be evaluated with empty datasets: be sure any signal expressions behave appropriately with empty data, including downstream concerns such as empty scale domains.

      copy
      Boolean
      A boolean flag (default false) that indicates if input JSON data should be copied prior to use. This setting may be useful when providing as input pre-parsed JSON data (e.g., not loaded from a URL) that should not be modified.

topojson

Load a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file using the TopoJSON format. The input file must contain valid TopoJSON data. The TopoJSON input is then converted into a GeoJSON format for use within Vega. There are two mutually exclusive properties that can be used to specify the conversion process:

For example, in a map of the world, there may be an object set named "countries". Using the feature property, we can extract this set and generate a GeoJSON feature object for each country.\nThe name of the TopoJSON object set to convert to a mesh. Similar to the feature option, mesh extracts a named TopoJSON object set. Unlike the feature option, the corresponding geo data is returned as a single, unified mesh instance, not as individual GeoJSON features. Extracting a mesh is useful for more efficiently drawing borders or other geographic elements that you do not need to associate with specific regions such as individual countries, states or counties.\nAn optional filter to apply to an extracted mesh. If set to "interior", only interior region boundaries are included, filtering out exterior borders. If set to "exterior", only the exterior border is included, filtering out all internal boundaries. If null or unspecified (the default), no filtering is performed. This property applies to mesh extraction only, not feature extraction. ≥ 5.4\nThe JSON property containing the desired data. Similar to type=json, this optional parameter can be used when the loaded TopoJSON data has surrounding structure or meta-data.\nA boolean flag (default false) that indicates if input JSON data should be copied prior to use. Similar to type=json, this setting may be useful when providing as input pre-parsed JSON data (e.g., not loaded from a URL) that should not be modified.\nHere is an example defining data directly in a specification:\n{"name": "table", "values": [12, 23, 47, 6, 52, 19]}\n{"name": "table", "values": [12, 23, 47, 6, 52, 19]}\nOne can also load data from an external file (in this case, a JSON file):\n{"name": "points", "url": "data/points.json"}\n{"name": "points", "url": "data/points.json"}\nOr, one can simply declare the existence of a data set. The data can then be dynamically provided when the visualization is instantiated. See the View API documentation for more.\nFinally, one can draw from an existing data set and apply new data transforms. In this case, we create a new data set ("stats") by computing aggregate statistics for groups drawn from the source "table" data set:\n{
  "name": "stats",
  "source": "table",
  "transform": [
    {
      "type": "aggregate",
      "groupby": ["x"],
      "ops": ["average", "sum", "min", "max"],
      "fields": ["y", "y", "y", "y"]
    }
  ]
}\n{
  "name": "stats",
  "source": "table",
  "transform": [
    {
      "type": "aggregate",
      "groupby": ["x"],
      "ops": ["average", "sum", "min", "max"],
      "fields": ["y", "y", "y", "y"]
    }
  ]
}\n\n\nVega

    Transforms
    Transforms process a data stream to filter data, calculate new fields, or derive new data streams. Transforms are typically specified within the transform array of a data definition. In addition, transforms that do not filter or generate new data objects can be used within the transform array of a mark definition to specify post-encoding transforms.

The following example defines a new data set with transforms to filter values and then compute a stacked layout (e.g., for a stacked bar chart):

{
  "data": [
    {
      "name": "table",
      "transform": [
        { "type": "filter", "expr": "datum.value > 5" },
        { "type": "stack", "field": "value", "groupby": ["category"] }
      ]
    }
  ]
}


All transforms require a type property, specifying the name of the transform. Transforms that produce a value as a side-effect (in particular, the bin, extent, and crossfilter transforms) can include a signal property to specify a unique signal name to which to bind the transform’s state value.

  fold - Collapse selected data fields into key and value properties.
  formula - Extend data objects with derived fields using a formula expression.
  identifier - Assign unique key values to data objects.
  kde - Estimate smoothed densities for numeric values. ≥ 5.4
  impute - Perform imputation of missing values.
  joinaggregate - Extend data objects with calculated aggregate values.
  loess - Fit a smoothed trend line using local regression. ≥ 5.4
  lookup - Extend data objects by looking up key values on another stream.
  pivot - Pivot unique values to new aggregate fields. ≥ 3.2
  project - Generate derived data objects with a selected set of fields.
  quantile - Calculate sample quantile values over an input data stream. ≥ 5.7
  regression - Fit regression models to smooth and predict values. ≥ 5.4
  sample - Randomly sample data objects in a stream.
  sequence - Generate a new stream containing a sequence of numeric values.
  timeunit - Discretize date-time values into time unit bins. ≥ 5.8
  window - Calculate over ordered groups, including ranking and running totals.


Geographic and Spatial Transforms

Transforms for modeling spatial data, cartographic projection, and geographic guides.


  contour - Deprecated. Model a spatial distribution using discrete levels.
  geojson - Consolidate geographic data into a GeoJSON feature collection.
  geopath - Map GeoJSON features to SVG path strings.
  geopoint - Map (longitude, latitude) coordinates to (x, y) points.
  geoshape - Map GeoJSON features to a shape instance for procedural drawing.
  graticule - Generate a reference grid for cartographic maps.
  heatmap - Generate heatmap images for raster grid data. ≥ 5.8
  isocontour - Generate level set contours for raster grid data. ≥ 5.8
  kde2d - Estimate 2D densities as output raster grids. ≥ 5.8


Layout Transforms

Transforms for calculating spatial coordinates to achieve various layouts.


  force - Compute a force-directed layout via physical simulation.
  label - Compute text position and opacity to label a chart. ≥ 5.16
  linkpath - Route visual links between node elements.
  pie - Compute angular layout for pie and donut charts.
  stack - Compute stacked layouts for groups of values.
  voronoi - Compute a Voronoi diagram for a set of points.
  wordcloud - Compute a word cloud layout of text strings.


Hierarchy Transforms

Transforms for processing hierarchy (tree) data and performing tree layout.


  nest - Generate a tree structure by grouping objects by field values.
  stratify - Generate a tree structure using explicit key values.
  treelinks - Generate link data objects for a tree structure.
  pack - Tree layout based on circular enclosure.
  partition - Tree layout based on spatial adjacency of nodes.
  tree - Tree layout for a node-link diagram.
  treemap - Tree layout based on recursive rectangular subdivision.


Cross-Filter Transforms

Transforms for supporting fast incremental filtering of multi-dimensional data.


  crossfilter - Maintain a filter mask for multiple dimensional queries.
  resolvefilter - Resolve crossfilter output to generate filtered data streams.


Custom Transforms

In addition to the above, custom transformations can also be added to Vega as part of its Extensibility API.

    Transforms
    Transforms process a data stream to filter data, calculate new fields, or derive new data streams. Transforms are typically specified within the transform array of a data definition. In addition, transforms that do not filter or generate new data objects can be used within the transform array of a mark definition to specify post-encoding transforms.

The following example defines a new data set with transforms to filter values and then compute a stacked layout (e.g., for a stacked bar chart):

{
  "data": [
    {
      "name": "table",
      "transform": [
        { "type": "filter", "expr": "datum.value > 5" },
        { "type": "stack", "field": "value", "groupby": ["category"] }
      ]
    }
  ]
}


All transforms require a type property, specifying the name of the transform. Transforms that produce a value as a side-effect (in particular, the bin, extent, and crossfilter transforms) can include a signal property to specify a unique signal name to which to bind the transform’s state value.

    Scales
    Scales map data values (numbers, dates, categories, etc.) to visual values (pixels, colors, sizes). Scales are a fundamental building block of data visualization, as they determine the nature of visual encodings. Vega includes a range of scales for both continuous and discrete input data, and supports mappings for position, shape, size and color encodings.

To visualize scales, Vega specifications may include axes or legends. For more about supported color encodings, see the color scheme reference. Internally, Vega uses the scales provided by the d3-scale library; for more background see Introducing d3-scale by Mike Bostock.

Scale Properties

Properties shared across scale types.


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      name
      String
      Required. A unique name for the scale. Scales and projections share the same namespace; names must be unique across both.
    
    
      type
      String
      The type of scale (default linear). See the  scale type reference for more.
    
    
      domain
      Domain
      The domain of input data values for the scale. For quantitative data, this can take the form of a two-element array with minimum and maximum values. For ordinal or categorical data, this may be an array of valid input values. The domain may also be specified as a reference to a data source. See the scale domain reference for more.
    
    
      domainMax
      Number
      Sets the maximum value in the scale domain, overriding the domain property. The domainMax property is only intended for use with scales having continuous domains.
    
    
      domainMin
      Number
      Sets the minimum value in the scale domain, overriding the domain property. The domainMin property is only intended for use with scales having continuous domains.
    
    
      domainMid
      Number
      Inserts a single mid-point value into a two-element domain. The mid-point value must lie between the domain minimum and maximum values. This property can be useful for setting a midpoint for diverging color scales. The domainMid property is only intended for use with scales supporting continuous, piecewise domains.
    
    
      domainRaw
      Array
      An array of raw values that, if non-null, directly overrides the domain property. This is useful for supporting interactions such as panning or zooming a scale. The scale may be initially determined using a data-driven domain, then modified in response to user input by setting the rawDomain value.
    
    
      interpolate
      String | Object
      The interpolation method for range values. By default, continuous scales use a general interpolator for numbers, dates, strings and colors (in RGB space) is used. For color ranges, this property allows interpolation in alternative color spaces. Legal values include rgb, hsl, hsl-long, lab, hcl, hcl-long, cubehelix and cubehelix-long (‘-long’ variants use longer paths in polar coordinate spaces). If object-valued, this property accepts an object with a string-valued type property and an optional numeric gamma property applicable to rgb and cubehelix interpolators. For more, see the d3-interpolate documentation.
    
    
      range
      Range
      The range of the scale, representing the set of visual values. For numeric values, the range typically takes the form of a two-element array with minimum and maximum values. For ordinal or quantized data, the range may be an array of desired output values, which are mapped to elements in the specified domain. See the scale range reference for more.
    
    
      reverse
      Boolean
      A boolean flag (default false) that reverses the order of the scale range.
    
    
      round
      Boolean
      A boolean flag (default false) that rounds numeric output values to integers. Helpful for snapping to a pixel grid.

Quantitative Scales

A quantitative scale maps a continuous domain (numbers or dates) to a continuous output range (pixel locations, sizes, colors). The available quantitative scale type values are linear, log, pow, sqrt, symlog, time and utc. All quantitative scales except for time and utc use a default domain of [0, 1] and default unit range [0, 1].

All quantitative scales support color-valued ranges, defined either as an array of color strings or as a scheme specification. If the domain includes two color values, a sequential color scale is used. If the domain includes three color values, a diverging color scale is used. For larger domain sizes, the domain and range should have the same number of values, over which piecewise interpolation will be applied.


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      bins
      Bins
      ≥ 5.0 Bin boundaries over the scale domain, such as those computed by Vega’s bin transform. If provided, axes and legends will use the bin boundaries to inform the choice of axis tick marks and legend labels. This property can be either an explicit array of bin boundary values or a specification object, see the scale bins reference for more.
    
    
      clamp
      Boolean
      A boolean indicating if output values should be clamped to the range (default false). If clamping is disabled and the scale is passed a value outside the domain, the scale may return a value outside the range through extrapolation. If clamping is enabled, the output value of the scale is always within the scale’s range.
    
    
      padding
      Number
      Expands the scale domain to accommodate the specified number of pixels on each of the scale range. The scale range must represent pixels for this parameter to function as intended. Padding adjustment is performed prior to all other adjustments, including the effects of the zero, nice, domainMin, and domainMax properties.
    
    
      nice
      Boolean | Number | Signal
      Extends the domain so that it starts and ends on nice round values (default false). This method typically modifies the scale’s domain, and may only extend the bounds to the nearest round value. Nicing is useful if the domain is computed from data and may be irregular. For example, for a domain of [0.201479…, 0.996679…], a nice domain might be [0.2, 1.0]. Domain values set via domainMin and domainMax (but not domainRaw) are subject to nicing. Using a number value for this parameter (representing a desired tick count) allows greater control over the step size used to extend the bounds, guaranteeing that the returned ticks will exactly cover the domain.
    
    
      zero
      Boolean
      Boolean flag indicating if the scale domain should include zero. The default value is true for linear, sqrt and pow, and false otherwise.
    
  


Linear Scales

Linear scales (linear) are quantitative scales scales that preserve proportional differences. Each range value y can be expressed as a linear function of the domain value x: y = mx + b.

Logarithmic Scales

Log scales (log) are quantitative scales scales in which a logarithmic transform is applied to the input domain value before the output range value is computed. Log scales are particularly useful for plotting data that varies over multiple orders of magnitude. The mapping to the range value y can be expressed as a logarithmic function of the domain value x: y = m log(x) + b.

As log(0) = -∞, a log scale domain must be strictly-positive or strictly-negative; the domain must not include or cross zero. A log scale with a positive domain has a well-defined behavior for positive values, and a log scale with a negative domain has a well-defined behavior for negative values. (For a negative domain, input and output values are implicitly multiplied by -1.) The behavior of the scale is undefined if you run a negative value through a log scale with a positive domain or vice versa.


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      base
      Number
      The base of the logarithm (default 10).
    
  


Power Scales

Power scales (pow) are quantitative scales scales that apply an exponential transform to the input domain value before the output range value is computed. Each range value y can be expressed as a polynomial function of the domain value x: y = mx^k + b, where k is the exponent value. Power scales also support negative domain values, in which case the input value and the resulting output value are multiplied by -1.


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      exponent
      Number
      The exponent to use in the scale transform (default 1).
    
  


Square Root Scales

Square root (sqrt) scales are a convenient shorthand for power scales with an exponent of 0.5, indicating a square root transform.

Symmetric Log Scales ≥ 5.0

Symmetric log scales (symlog) are quantitative scales scales that provide scaling similar to log scales, but supports non-positive numbers. Symlog scales are particularly useful for plotting data that varies over multiple orders of magnitude but includes negative- or zero-valued data. For more, see “A bi-symmetric log transformation for wide-range data” by Webber for more.


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      constant
      Number
      A constant determining the slope of the symlog function around zero (default 1).
    
  


Time and UTC Scales

Time scales (time and utc) are quantitative scales with a temporal domain: values in the input domain are assumed to be Date objects or timestamps. The time scale type uses the current local timezone setting. UTC scales (utc) instead use Coordinated Universal Time. Both time and utc scales use a default domain of [2000-01-01, 2000-01-02], and a default unit range [0, 1].


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      nice
      String | Object | Number | Boolean
      If specified, modifies the scale domain to use a more human-friendly value range. For time and utc scale types, the nice value can additionally be a string indicating the desired time interval. Legal values are "millisecond", "second", "minute", "hour", "day", "week", "month", and "year". Alternatively, time and utc scales can accept an object-valued interval specifier of the form {"interval": "month", "step": 3}, which includes a desired number of interval steps. Here, the domain would snap to quarter (Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct) boundaries.
    
  


Sequential Scales (Deprecated)

Sequential scales (sequential) are similar to linear scales, but use a fixed interpolator to determine the output range. As of Vega 5.0, sequential scales are deprecated: specifications should now use a linear (or log, etc.) scale with a color-valued range, rather than  a sequential scale.


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      clamp
      Boolean
      A boolean indicating if output values should be clamped to the range (default false). If clamping is disabled and the scale is passed a value outside the domain, the scale may return a value outside the range through extrapolation. If clamping is enabled, the output value of the scale is always within the scale’s range.
    
    
      domainMax
      Number
      Sets the maximum value in the scale domain, overriding the domain property.
    
    
      domainMin
      Number
      Sets the minimum value in the scale domain, overriding the domain property.
    
    
      domainMid
      Number
      Inserts a single mid-point value into a two-element domain. The mid-point value must lie between the domain minimum and maximum values. This property can be useful for setting a midpoint for diverging color scales.
    
    
      range
      Scheme | Color[ ]
      Required. The range value should either be a color scheme object or an array of color strings. If an array of colors is provided, the array will be used to create a continuous interpolator via linear interpolation in the RGB color space.

Discrete Scales

Discrete scales map values from a discrete domain to a discrete range. In the case of band and point scales, the range is determined by discretizing a continuous numeric range.

Ordinal Scales

Ordinal scales (ordinal) have a discrete domain and range. For example, an ordinal scale might map a set of named categories to a set of colors, or to a set of shapes. Ordinal scales function as a “lookup table” from a domain value to a range value.

This example uses an ordinal scale for color-coded categories, with up to 20 unique colors:

{
  "scales": [
    {
      "name": "color",
      "type": "ordinal",
      "domain": {"data": "table", "field": "category"},
      "range": {"scheme": "category20"}
    }
  ]
}


Band Scales

Band scales (band) accept a discrete domain similar to ordinal scales, but map this domain to a continuous, numeric output range such as pixels. Discrete output values are automatically computed by the scale by dividing the continuous range into uniform bands. Band scales are typically used for bar charts with an ordinal or categorical dimension.

In addition to a standard numerical range value (such as [0, 500]), band scales can be given a fixed step size for each band. The actual range is then determined by both the step size and the cardinality (element count) of the input domain. The step size is specified by an object with a step property that provides the step size in pixels, for example "range": {"step": 20}.

This image from the d3-scale documentation illustrates how a band scale works:




  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      align
      Number
      The alignment of elements within the scale range. This value must lie in the range [0,1]. A value of 0.5 (default) indicates that the bands should be centered within the range. A value of 0 or 1 may be used to shift the bands to one side, say to position them adjacent to an axis. For more, see this explainer for D3 band align.
    
    
      domainImplicit
      Boolean
      A boolean flag (default false) indicating if an ordinal domain should be implicitly extended with new values. If false, the scale will return undefined for values not explicitly included in the domain. If true, new values will be appended to the domain and the matching range value will be returned.
    
    
      padding
      Number
      Sets paddingInner and paddingOuter to the same padding value (default 0). This value must lie in the range [0,1].
    
    
      paddingInner
      Number
      The inner padding (spacing) within each band step, as a fraction of the step size (default 0). This value must lie in the range [0,1].
    
    
      paddingOuter
      Number
      The outer padding (spacing) at the ends of the scale range, as a fraction of the step size (default 0). This value must lie in the range [0,1].
    
  


Point Scales

Point scales (point) are a variant of band scales where the internal band width is fixed to zero. Point scales are typically used for scatterplots with an ordinal or categorical dimension. Similar to band scales, point scale range values may be specified using either a numerical extent ([0, 500]) or a step size ({"step": 20}). As point scales do not have internal band widths (only step sizes between bands), they do not accept the paddingInner property.

This image from the d3-scale documentation illustrates how a point scale works:




  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      align
      Number
      The alignment of elements within the scale range. This value must lie in the range [0,1]. A value of 0.5 (default) indicates that the points should be centered within the range. A value of 0 or 1 may be used to shift the points to one side, say to position them adjacent to an axis.
    
    
      padding
      Number
      An alias for paddingOuter (default 0). This value must lie in the range [0,1].
    
    
      paddingOuter
      Number
      The outer padding (spacing) at the ends of the scale range, as a fraction of the step size (default 0). This value must lie in the range [0,1].

Discretizing Scales

Discretizing scales break up a continuous domain into discrete segments, and then map values in each segment to a range value.

Quantile Scales

Quantile scales (quantile) map a sample of input domain values to a discrete range based on computed quantile boundaries. The domain is considered continuous and thus the scale will accept any reasonable input value; however, the domain is specified as a discrete set of sample values. The number of values in (i.e., the cardinality of) the output range determines the number of quantiles that will be computed from the domain. To compute the quantiles, the domain is sorted, and treated as a population of discrete values. The resulting quantile boundaries segment the domain into groups with roughly equal numbers of sample points per group.

Quantile scales are particularly useful for creating color or size encodings with a fixed number of output values. Using a discrete set of encoding levels (typically between 5-9 colors or sizes) sometimes supports more accurate perceptual comparison than a continuous range. For related functionality see quantize scales, which partition the domain into uniform domain extents, rather than groups with equal element counts. Quantile scales have the benefit of evenly distributing data points to encoded values. In contrast, quantize scales uniformly segment the input domain and provide no guarantee on how data points will be distributed among the output visual values.

This example color-codes quantile values in five groups, using colors sampled from a continuous color scheme:

{
  "name": "color",
  "scale": "quantile",
  "domain": {"data": "table", "field": "value"},
  "range": {"scheme": "plasma", "count": 5}
}


Quantize Scales

Quantize scales (quantize) are similar to linear scales, except they use a discrete rather than continuous range. The continuous input domain is divided into uniform segments based on the number of values in (i.e., the cardinality of) the output range. Each range value y can be expressed as a quantized linear function of the domain value x: y = m round(x) + b.

Quantize scales are particularly useful for creating color or size encodings with a fixed number of output values. Using a discrete set of encoding levels (typically between 5-9 colors or sizes) sometimes supports more accurate perceptual comparison than a continuous range. For related functionality see quantile scales, which partition the domain into groups with equal element counts, rather than uniform domain extents.


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      nice
      Boolean | Number
      Extends the domain so that it starts and ends on nice round values (default false). This method typically modifies the scale’s domain, and may only extend the bounds to the nearest round value. Nicing is useful if the domain is computed from data and may be irregular. For example, for a domain of [0.201479…, 0.996679…], a nice domain might be [0.2, 1.0]. Domain values set via domainMin and domainMax (but not domainRaw) are subject to nicing. Using a number value for this parameter (representing a desired tick count) allows greater control over the step size used to extend the bounds, guaranteeing that the returned ticks will exactly cover the domain.
    
    
      zero
      Boolean
      Boolean flag indicating if the scale domain should include zero (default false).
    
  


This example color-codes a quantized domain using a 7-point color scheme:

{
  "name": "color",
  "scale": "quantize",
  "domain": {"data": "table", "field": "value"},
  "range": {"scheme": "blues", "count": 7}
}


Threshold Scales

Threshold scales (threshold) are similar to quantize scales, except they allow mapping of arbitrary subsets of the domain (not uniform segments) to discrete values in the range. The input domain is still continuous, and divided into slices based on a set of threshold values provided to the domain property. The range property must have N+1 elements, where N is the number of threshold boundaries provided in the domain.

Given the following scale definition,

{
  "name": "threshold",
  "type": "threshold",
  "domain": [0, 1],
  "range": ["red", "white", "blue"]
}


the scale will map domain values to color strings as follows:

-1   => "red"
0    => "white"
0.5  => "white"
1.0  => "blue"
1000 => "blue"


Bin-Ordinal Scales

Binned ordinal scales (bin-ordinal) are a special type of ordinal scale for use with data that has been subdivided into bins (for example, using Vega’s bin transform). The main benefit of using bin-ordinal scales is that they provide “bin-aware” routines for sampling values and generating labels for inclusion in legends. They are particularly useful for creating binned color encodings.

The domain values for a binned ordinal scale must be the set of all bin boundaries, from the minimum bin start to maximum bin end. Input domain values are discretized to the appropriate bin, which is then treated as a standard ordinal scale input. However, as the domain property only accepts an array of values, the bin-ordinal scale provides a bins property that also accepts a bin specification and can be used instead of an explicit domain property.


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      bins
      Bins
      ≥ 5.0 Bin boundaries over the scale domain, such as those computed by Vega’s bin transform. This property can be either an explicit array of bin boundary values or a specification object, see the scale bins reference for more. If the domain property is not defined, bins will be used to determine the scale domain.
    
  


Here is an example of a bin-ordinal scale defined in conjunction with a bin transform:

{
  "data": [
    {
      "name": "input",
      "transform": [
        { "type": "extent", "field": "value", "signal": "extent" },
        { "type": "bin", "extent": {"signal": "extent"}, "signal": "bins" }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "scales": [
    {
      "name": "color",
      "type": "bin-ordinal",
      "bins": {"signal": "bins"},
      "range": {"scheme": "greens"}
    }
  ]
}

Scale Bins

Bin boundaries can be provided to scales as either an explicit array of bin boundaries or as a bin specification object. The legal values are:


  A signal reference that resolves to either an array or bin specification object.
  An array literal of bin boundary values. For example, [0, 5, 10, 15, 20]. The array must include both starting and ending boundaries. The previous example uses five values to indicate a total of four bin intervals: [0-5), [5-10), [10-15), [15-20]. Array literals may include signal references as elements.
  A bin specification object that indicates the bin step size, and optionally the start and stop boundaries. The output value of a bin transform is a valid bin specification object.



  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      start
      Number
      The starting (lowest-valued) bin boundary. If not defined, the lowest value of the scale domain will be used.
    
    
      stop
      Number
      The stopping (highest-valued) bin boundary. If not defined, the highest value of the scale domain will be used.
    
    
      step
      Number
      Required. The step size defining the bin interval width.
    
  


Scale Domains

Scale domains can be specified in multiple ways:


  As an array literal of domain values. For example, [0, 500] or ['a', 'b', 'c']. Array literals may include signal references as elements.
  A signal reference that resolves to a domain value array. For example, {"signal": "myDomain"}.
  A data reference object that specifies field values in one or more data sets.


Basic Data Reference

A basic data reference indicates a data set, field name, and optional sorting for discrete scales:


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      data
      String
      Required. The name of the data set containing domain values.
    
    
      field
      Field
      Required. The name of the data field (e.g., "price").
    
    
      sort
      Boolean | Sort
      If a boolean true value, sort the domain values in ascending order. If object-valued, sort the domain according to the provided sort parameters. Sorting is only supported for discrete scale types.
    
  


For example, "domain": {"data": "table", "field": "value"}, derives a scale domain from the value field of data objects in the table data set. If the scale type is quantitative or a quantize, the derived domain will be a two-element [min, max] array. If the scale type is discrete, the derived domain will be an array of all distinct values. If the scale type is quantile, all values will be used to compute quantile boundaries.

Multi-Field Data References

Scale domains can also be derived using values from multiple fields. Multiple fields from the same data set can be specified by replacing the field property with a fields property that takes an array of field names:


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      data
      String
      Required. The name of the data set containing domain values.
    
    
      fields
      Field[ ]
      Required. The names of the data field (e.g., ["price", "cost"]).
    
    
      sort
      Boolean | Sort
      If a boolean true value, sort the domain values in ascending order. If object-valued, sort the domain according to the provided sort parameters. Sorting is only supported for discrete scale types.
    
  


More generally, scale domains may also use values pulled from different data sets. In this case, the domain object should have a fields property, which is an array of basic data references:


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      fields
      DataRef[ ]
      Required. An array of basic data references indicating each data set and field value to include in the domain. In addition, array literals (e.g., [0, 100], ["a", "b", "c"]) may be included as elements of the fields array for inclusion in the domain determination.
    
    
      sort
      Boolean | Sort
      If a boolean true value, sort the domain values in ascending order. If object-valued, sort the domain according to the provided sort parameters. Sorting is only supported for discrete scale types.
    
  


Here is an example that constructs a domain using the fields price and cost drawn from two different data sets:

"domain": {
  "fields": [
    {"data": "table1", "field": "price"},
    {"data": "table2", "field": "cost"}
   ]
}


Sorting Domains

The sort property of a domain data reference can accept, in addition to a simple boolean, an object-valued sort definition:


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      field
      Field
      The data field to sort by. If unspecified, defaults to the field specified in the outer data reference.
    
    
      op
      String
      An aggregate operation to perform on the field prior to sorting. Examples include count, mean and median. This property is required in cases where the sort field and the data reference field do not match. The input data objects will be aggregated, grouped by data reference field values. For a full list of operations, see the aggregate transform, and also see below for limitations with multi-field domains.
    
    
      order
      String
      The sort order. One of ascending (default) or descending.
    
  


This example sorts distinct category field values in descending order by the associated median of the value field:

{
  "domain": {
    "data": "table",
    "field": "category",
    "sort": {"op": "median", "field": "value", "order": "descending"}
  }
}


This example sorts a multi-field domain in descending order based on the counts of each of the domain values:

{
  "domain": {
    "data": "table",
    "fields": ["category1", "category2"],
    "sort": {"op": "count", "order": "descending"}
  }
}


Note: For multi-field domains, the sort field values may not be undefined across all input data sets, and will exhibit duplicate values when drawing multiple domain values from the same data set. To avoid inaccurate sorting, the only allowed sort op values for multi-domain scales are count, min, and max. Support for min and max is available in versions ≥ 5.5.

Scale Ranges

Scale ranges can be specified in multiple ways:


  As an array literal of range values. For example, [0, 500] or ['a', 'b', 'c']. Array literals may include signal references as elements.
  A signal reference that resolves to a range value array. For example, {"signal": "myRange"}.
  A color scheme reference for a color palette. For example, {"scheme": "blueorange"}.
  For ordinal scales only, a data reference for a set of distinct field values. For example, {"data": "table", "field": "value"}.
  For band and point scales only, a step size for each range band. For example, {"step": 20}.
  A string indicating a pre-defined scale range default. For example, "width", "symbol", or "diverging".


Scale Range Defaults

Scale ranges can also accept string literals that map to default values. Default values can be modified, and new named defaults can be added, by using custom config settings.


  
    
      Value
      Description
    
  
  
    
      "width"
      A spatial range determined by the value of the width signal.
    
    
      "height"
      A spatial range determined by the value of the height signal. The direction of the range (top-to-bottom or bottom-to-top) is automatically determined according to the scale type.
    
    
      "symbol"
      The default plotting symbol set to use for shape encodings.
    
    
      "category"
      The default categorical color scheme to use for nominal data.
    
    
      "diverging"
      The default diverging color scheme to use for quantitative data.
    
    
      "ordinal"
      The default sequential color scheme to use for ordinal data.
    
    
      "ramp"
      The default sequential color scheme to use for quantitative data.
    
    
      "heatmap"
      The default sequential color scheme to use for quantitative heatmaps.\nVega

    Scales
    Scales map data values (numbers, dates, categories, etc.) to visual values (pixels, colors, sizes). Scales are a fundamental building block of data visualization, as they determine the nature of visual encodings. Vega includes a range of scales for both continuous and discrete input data, and supports mappings for position, shape, size and color encodings.

To visualize scales, Vega specifications may include axes or legends. For more about supported color encodings, see the color scheme reference. Internally, Vega uses the scales provided by the d3-scale library; for more background see Introducing d3-scale by Mike Bostock.

Scale Properties

Properties shared across scale types.


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      name
      String
      Required. A unique name for the scale. Scales and projections share the same namespace; names must be unique across both.
    
    
      type
      String
      The type of scale (default linear). See the  scale type reference for more.
    
    
      domain
      Domain
      The domain of input data values for the scale. For quantitative data, this can take the form of a two-element array with minimum and maximum values. For ordinal or categorical data, this may be an array of valid input values. The domain may also be specified as a reference to a data source. See the scale domain reference for more.
    
    
      domainMax
      Number
      Sets the maximum value in the scale domain, overriding the domain property. The domainMax property is only intended for use with scales having continuous domains.
    
    
      domainMin
      Number
      Sets the minimum value in the scale domain, overriding the domain property. The domainMin property is only intended for use with scales having continuous domains.
    
    
      domainMid
      Number
      Inserts a single mid-point value into a two-element domain. The mid-point value must lie between the domain minimum and maximum values. This property can be useful for setting a midpoint for diverging color scales. The domainMid property is only intended for use with scales supporting continuous, piecewise domains.
    
    
      domainRaw
      Array
      An array of raw values that, if non-null, directly overrides the domain property. This is useful for supporting interactions such as panning or zooming a scale. The scale may be initially determined using a data-driven domain, then modified in response to user input by setting the rawDomain value.
    
    
      interpolate
      String | Object
      The interpolation method for range values. By default, continuous scales use a general interpolator for numbers, dates, strings and colors (in RGB space) is used. For color ranges, this property allows interpolation in alternative color spaces. Legal values include rgb, hsl, hsl-long, lab, hcl, hcl-long, cubehelix and cubehelix-long (‘-long’ variants use longer paths in polar coordinate spaces). If object-valued, this property accepts an object with a string-valued type property and an optional numeric gamma property applicable to rgb and cubehelix interpolators. For more, see the d3-interpolate documentation.
    
    
      range
      Range
      The range of the scale, representing the set of visual values. For numeric values, the range typically takes the form of a two-element array with minimum and maximum values. For ordinal or quantized data, the range may be an array of desired output values, which are mapped to elements in the specified domain. See the scale range reference for more.
    
    
      reverse
      Boolean
      A boolean flag (default false) that reverses the order of the scale range.
    
    
      round
      Boolean
      A boolean flag (default false) that rounds numeric output values to integers. Helpful for snapping to a pixel grid.

Quantitative Scales

A quantitative scale maps a continuous domain (numbers or dates) to a continuous output range (pixel locations, sizes, colors). The available quantitative scale type values are linear, log, pow, sqrt, symlog, time and utc. All quantitative scales except for time and utc use a default domain of [0, 1] and default unit range [0, 1].

All quantitative scales support color-valued ranges, defined either as an array of color strings or as a scheme specification. If the domain includes two color values, a sequential color scale is used. If the domain includes three color values, a diverging color scale is used. For larger domain sizes, the domain and range should have the same number of values, over which piecewise interpolation will be applied.


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      bins
      Bins
      ≥ 5.0 Bin boundaries over the scale domain, such as those computed by Vega’s bin transform. If provided, axes and legends will use the bin boundaries to inform the choice of axis tick marks and legend labels. This property can be either an explicit array of bin boundary values or a specification object, see the scale bins reference for more.
    
    
      clamp
      Boolean
      A boolean indicating if output values should be clamped to the range (default false). If clamping is disabled and the scale is passed a value outside the domain, the scale may return a value outside the range through extrapolation. If clamping is enabled, the output value of the scale is always within the scale’s range.
    
    
      padding
      Number
      Expands the scale domain to accommodate the specified number of pixels on each of the scale range. The scale range must represent pixels for this parameter to function as intended. Padding adjustment is performed prior to all other adjustments, including the effects of the zero, nice, domainMin, and domainMax properties.
    
    
      nice
      Boolean | Number | Signal
      Extends the domain so that it starts and ends on nice round values (default false). This method typically modifies the scale’s domain, and may only extend the bounds to the nearest round value. Nicing is useful if the domain is computed from data and may be irregular. For example, for a domain of [0.201479…, 0.996679…], a nice domain might be [0.2, 1.0]. Domain values set via domainMin and domainMax (but not domainRaw) are subject to nicing. Using a number value for this parameter (representing a desired tick count) allows greater control over the step size used to extend the bounds, guaranteeing that the returned ticks will exactly cover the domain.
    
    
      zero
      Boolean
      Boolean flag indicating if the scale domain should include zero. The default value is true for linear, sqrt and pow, and false otherwise.
    
  


Linear Scales

Linear scales (linear) are quantitative scales scales that preserve proportional differences. Each range value y can be expressed as a linear function of the domain value x: y = mx + b.

Logarithmic Scales

Log scales (log) are quantitative scales scales in which a logarithmic transform is applied to the input domain value before the output range value is computed. Log scales are particularly useful for plotting data that varies over multiple orders of magnitude. The mapping to the range value y can be expressed as a logarithmic function of the domain value x: y = m log(x) + b.

As log(0) = -∞, a log scale domain must be strictly-positive or strictly-negative; the domain must not include or cross zero. A log scale with a positive domain has a well-defined behavior for positive values, and a log scale with a negative domain has a well-defined behavior for negative values. (For a negative domain, input and output values are implicitly multiplied by -1.) The behavior of the scale is undefined if you run a negative value through a log scale with a positive domain or vice versa.

      The base of the logarithm (default 10).
    
  


Power Scales

Power scales (pow) are quantitative scales scales that apply an exponential transform to the input domain value before the output range value is computed. Each range value y can be expressed as a polynomial function of the domain value x: y = mx^k + b, where k is the exponent value. Power scales also support negative domain values, in which case the input value and the resulting output value are multiplied by -1.


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      exponent
      Number
      The exponent to use in the scale transform (default 1).
    
  


Square Root Scales

Square root (sqrt) scales are a convenient shorthand for power scales with an exponent of 0.5, indicating a square root transform.

Symmetric Log Scales ≥ 5.0

Symmetric log scales (symlog) are quantitative scales scales that provide scaling similar to log scales, but supports non-positive numbers. Symlog scales are particularly useful for plotting data that varies over multiple orders of magnitude but includes negative- or zero-valued data. For more, see “A bi-symmetric log transformation for wide-range data” by Webber for more.


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      constant
      Number
      A constant determining the slope of the symlog function around zero (default 1).
    
  


Time and UTC Scales

Time scales (time and utc) are quantitative scales with a temporal domain: values in the input domain are assumed to be Date objects or timestamps. The time scale type uses the current local timezone setting. UTC scales (utc) instead use Coordinated Universal Time. Both time and utc scales use a default domain of [2000-01-01, 2000-01-02], and a default unit range [0, 1].


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      nice
      String | Object | Number | Boolean
      If specified, modifies the scale domain to use a more human-friendly value range. For time and utc scale types, the nice value can additionally be a string indicating the desired time interval. Legal values are "millisecond", "second", "minute", "hour", "day", "week", "month", and "year". Alternatively, time and utc scales can accept an object-valued interval specifier of the form {"interval": "month", "step": 3}, which includes a desired number of interval steps. Here, the domain would snap to quarter (Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct) boundaries.
    
  


Sequential Scales (Deprecated)

Sequential scales (sequential) are similar to linear scales, but use a fixed interpolator to determine the output range. As of Vega 5.0, sequential scales are deprecated: specifications should now use a linear (or log, etc.) scale with a color-valued range, rather than  a sequential scale.


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      clamp
      Boolean
      A boolean indicating if output values should be clamped to the range (default false). If clamping is disabled and the scale is passed a value outside the domain, the scale may return a value outside the range through extrapolation. If clamping is enabled, the output value of the scale is always within the scale’s range.
    
    
      domainMax
      Number
      Sets the maximum value in the scale domain, overriding the domain property.
    
    
      domainMin
      Number
      Sets the minimum value in the scale domain, overriding the domain property.
    
    
      domainMid
      Number
      Inserts a single mid-point value into a two-element domain. The mid-point value must lie between the domain minimum and maximum values. This property can be useful for setting a midpoint for diverging color scales.
    
    
      range
      Scheme | Color[ ]
      Required. The range value should either be a color scheme object or an array of color strings. If an array of colors is provided, the array will be used to create a continuous interpolator via linear interpolation in the RGB color space.

Discrete Scales

Discrete scales map values from a discrete domain to a discrete range. In the case of band and point scales, the range is determined by discretizing a continuous numeric range.

Ordinal Scales

Ordinal scales (ordinal) have a discrete domain and range. For example, an ordinal scale might map a set of named categories to a set of colors, or to a set of shapes. Ordinal scales function as a “lookup table” from a domain value to a range value.

This example uses an ordinal scale for color-coded categories, with up to 20 unique colors:

{
  "scales": [
    {
      "name": "color",
      "type": "ordinal",
      "domain": {"data": "table", "field": "category"},
      "range": {"scheme": "category20"}
    }
  ]
}


Band Scales

Band scales (band) accept a discrete domain similar to ordinal scales, but map this domain to a continuous, numeric output range such as pixels. Discrete output values are automatically computed by the scale by dividing the continuous range into uniform bands. Band scales are typically used for bar charts with an ordinal or categorical dimension.

In addition to a standard numerical range value (such as [0, 500]), band scales can be given a fixed step size for each band. The actual range is then determined by both the step size and the cardinality (element count) of the input domain. The step size is specified by an object with a step property that provides the step size in pixels, for example "range": {"step": 20}.

This image from the d3-scale documentation illustrates how a band scale works:




  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      align
      Number
      The alignment of elements within the scale range. This value must lie in the range [0,1]. A value of 0.5 (default) indicates that the bands should be centered within the range. A value of 0 or 1 may be used to shift the bands to one side, say to position them adjacent to an axis. For more, see this explainer for D3 band align.
    
    
      domainImplicit
      Boolean
      A boolean flag (default false) indicating if an ordinal domain should be implicitly extended with new values. If false, the scale will return undefined for values not explicitly included in the domain. If true, new values will be appended to the domain and the matching range value will be returned.
    
    
      padding
      Number
      Sets paddingInner and paddingOuter to the same padding value (default 0). This value must lie in the range [0,1].
    
    
      paddingInner
      Number
      The inner padding (spacing) within each band step, as a fraction of the step size (default 0). This value must lie in the range [0,1].
    
    
      paddingOuter
      Number
      The outer padding (spacing) at the ends of the scale range, as a fraction of the step size (default 0). This value must lie in the range [0,1].
    
  


Point Scales

Point scales (point) are a variant of band scales where the internal band width is fixed to zero. Point scales are typically used for scatterplots with an ordinal or categorical dimension. Similar to band scales, point scale range values may be specified using either a numerical extent ([0, 500]) or a step size ({"step": 20}). As point scales do not have internal band widths (only step sizes between bands), they do not accept the paddingInner property.

This image from the d3-scale documentation illustrates how a point scale works:




  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      align
      Number
      The alignment of elements within the scale range. This value must lie in the range [0,1]. A value of 0.5 (default) indicates that the points should be centered within the range. A value of 0 or 1 may be used to shift the points to one side, say to position them adjacent to an axis.
    
    
      padding
      Number
      An alias for paddingOuter (default 0). This value must lie in the range [0,1].
    
    
      paddingOuter
      Number
      The outer padding (spacing) at the ends of the scale range, as a fraction of the step size (default 0). This value must lie in the range [0,1].

Discretizing Scales

Discretizing scales break up a continuous domain into discrete segments, and then map values in each segment to a range value.

Quantile Scales

Quantile scales (quantile) map a sample of input domain values to a discrete range based on computed quantile boundaries. The domain is considered continuous and thus the scale will accept any reasonable input value; however, the domain is specified as a discrete set of sample values. The number of values in (i.e., the cardinality of) the output range determines the number of quantiles that will be computed from the domain. To compute the quantiles, the domain is sorted, and treated as a population of discrete values. The resulting quantile boundaries segment the domain into groups with roughly equal numbers of sample points per group.

Quantile scales are particularly useful for creating color or size encodings with a fixed number of output values. Using a discrete set of encoding levels (typically between 5-9 colors or sizes) sometimes supports more accurate perceptual comparison than a continuous range. For related functionality see quantize scales, which partition the domain into uniform domain extents, rather than groups with equal element counts. Quantile scales have the benefit of evenly distributing data points to encoded values. In contrast, quantize scales uniformly segment the input domain and provide no guarantee on how data points will be distributed among the output visual values.

This example color-codes quantile values in five groups, using colors sampled from a continuous color scheme:

{
  "name": "color",
  "scale": "quantile",
  "domain": {"data": "table", "field": "value"},
  "range": {"scheme": "plasma", "count": 5}
}


Quantize Scales

Quantize scales (quantize) are similar to linear scales, except they use a discrete rather than continuous range. The continuous input domain is divided into uniform segments based on the number of values in (i.e., the cardinality of) the output range. Each range value y can be expressed as a quantized linear function of the domain value x: y = m round(x) + b.

Quantize scales are particularly useful for creating color or size encodings with a fixed number of output values. Using a discrete set of encoding levels (typically between 5-9 colors or sizes) sometimes supports more accurate perceptual comparison than a continuous range. For related functionality see quantile scales, which partition the domain into groups with equal element counts, rather than uniform domain extents.


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      nice
      Boolean | Number
      Extends the domain so that it starts and ends on nice round values (default false). This method typically modifies the scale’s domain, and may only extend the bounds to the nearest round value. Nicing is useful if the domain is computed from data and may be irregular. For example, for a domain of [0.201479…, 0.996679…], a nice domain might be [0.2, 1.0]. Domain values set via domainMin and domainMax (but not domainRaw) are subject to nicing. Using a number value for this parameter (representing a desired tick count) allows greater control over the step size used to extend the bounds, guaranteeing that the returned ticks will exactly cover the domain.
    
    
      zero
      Boolean
      Boolean flag indicating if the scale domain should include zero (default false).
    
  


This example color-codes a quantized domain using a 7-point color scheme:

{
  "name": "color",
  "scale": "quantize",
  "domain": {"data": "table", "field": "value"},
  "range": {"scheme": "blues", "count": 7}
}


Threshold Scales

Threshold scales (threshold) are similar to quantize scales, except they allow mapping of arbitrary subsets of the domain (not uniform segments) to discrete values in the range. The input domain is still continuous, and divided into slices based on a set of threshold values provided to the domain property. The range property must have N+1 elements, where N is the number of threshold boundaries provided in the domain.

Given the following scale definition,

{
  "name": "threshold",
  "type": "threshold",
  "domain": [0, 1],
  "range": ["red", "white", "blue"]
}


the scale will map domain values to color strings as follows:

-1   => "red"
0    => "white"
0.5  => "white"
1.0  => "blue"
1000 => "blue"


Bin-Ordinal Scales

Binned ordinal scales (bin-ordinal) are a special type of ordinal scale for use with data that has been subdivided into bins (for example, using Vega’s bin transform). The main benefit of using bin-ordinal scales is that they provide “bin-aware” routines for sampling values and generating labels for inclusion in legends. They are particularly useful for creating binned color encodings.

The domain values for a binned ordinal scale must be the set of all bin boundaries, from the minimum bin start to maximum bin end. Input domain values are discretized to the appropriate bin, which is then treated as a standard ordinal scale input. However, as the domain property only accepts an array of values, the bin-ordinal scale provides a bins property that also accepts a bin specification and can be used instead of an explicit domain property.


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      bins
      Bins
      ≥ 5.0 Bin boundaries over the scale domain, such as those computed by Vega’s bin transform. This property can be either an explicit array of bin boundary values or a specification object, see the scale bins reference for more. If the domain property is not defined, bins will be used to determine the scale domain.
    
  


Here is an example of a bin-ordinal scale defined in conjunction with a bin transform:

{
  "data": [
    {
      "name": "input",
      "transform": [
        { "type": "extent", "field": "value", "signal": "extent" },
        { "type": "bin", "extent": {"signal": "extent"}, "signal": "bins" }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "scales": [
    {
      "name": "color",
      "type": "bin-ordinal",
      "bins": {"signal": "bins"},
      "range": {"scheme": "greens"}
    }
  ]
}

Scale Bins

Bin boundaries can be provided to scales as either an explicit array of bin boundaries or as a bin specification object. The legal values are:


  A signal reference that resolves to either an array or bin specification object.
  An array literal of bin boundary values. For example, [0, 5, 10, 15, 20]. The array must include both starting and ending boundaries. The previous example uses five values to indicate a total of four bin intervals: [0-5), [5-10), [10-15), [15-20]. Array literals may include signal references as elements.
  A bin specification object that indicates the bin step size, and optionally the start and stop boundaries. The output value of a bin transform is a valid bin specification object.



  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      start
      Number
      The starting (lowest-valued) bin boundary. If not defined, the lowest value of the scale domain will be used.
    
    
      stop
      Number
      The stopping (highest-valued) bin boundary. If not defined, the highest value of the scale domain will be used.
    
    
      step
      Number
      Required. The step size defining the bin interval width.
    
  


Scale Domains

Scale domains can be specified in multiple ways:


  As an array literal of domain values. For example, [0, 500] or ['a', 'b', 'c']. Array literals may include signal references as elements.
  A signal reference that resolves to a domain value array. For example, {"signal": "myDomain"}.
  A data reference object that specifies field values in one or more data sets.


Basic Data Reference

A basic data reference indicates a data set, field name, and optional sorting for discrete scales:


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      data
      String
      Required. The name of the data set containing domain values.
    
    
      field
      Field
      Required. The name of the data field (e.g., "price").
    
    
      sort
      Boolean | Sort
      If a boolean true value, sort the domain values in ascending order. If object-valued, sort the domain according to the provided sort parameters. Sorting is only supported for discrete scale types.
    
  


For example, "domain": {"data": "table", "field": "value"}, derives a scale domain from the value field of data objects in the table data set. If the scale type is quantitative or a quantize, the derived domain will be a two-element [min, max] array. If the scale type is discrete, the derived domain will be an array of all distinct values. If the scale type is quantile, all values will be used to compute quantile boundaries.

Multi-Field Data References

Scale domains can also be derived using values from multiple fields. Multiple fields from the same data set can be specified by replacing the field property with a fields property that takes an array of field names:


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      data
      String
      Required. The name of the data set containing domain values.
    
    
      fields
      Field[ ]
      Required. The names of the data field (e.g., ["price", "cost"]).
    
    
      sort
      Boolean | Sort
      If a boolean true value, sort the domain values in ascending order. If object-valued, sort the domain according to the provided sort parameters. Sorting is only supported for discrete scale types.
    
  


More generally, scale domains may also use values pulled from different data sets. In this case, the domain object should have a fields property, which is an array of basic data references:


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      fields
      DataRef[ ]
      Required. An array of basic data references indicating each data set and field value to include in the domain. In addition, array literals (e.g., [0, 100], ["a", "b", "c"]) may be included as elements of the fields array for inclusion in the domain determination.
    
    
      sort
      Boolean | Sort
      If a boolean true value, sort the domain values in ascending order. If object-valued, sort the domain according to the provided sort parameters. Sorting is only supported for discrete scale types.
    
  


Here is an example that constructs a domain using the fields price and cost drawn from two different data sets:

"domain": {
  "fields": [
    {"data": "table1", "field": "price"},
    {"data": "table2", "field": "cost"}
   ]
}


Sorting Domains

The sort property of a domain data reference can accept, in addition to a simple boolean, an object-valued sort definition:


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      field
      Field
      The data field to sort by. If unspecified, defaults to the field specified in the outer data reference.
    
    
      op
      String
      An aggregate operation to perform on the field prior to sorting. Examples include count, mean and median. This property is required in cases where the sort field and the data reference field do not match. The input data objects will be aggregated, grouped by data reference field values. For a full list of operations, see the aggregate transform, and also see below for limitations with multi-field domains.
    
    
      order
      String
      The sort order. One of ascending (default) or descending.
    
  


This example sorts distinct category field values in descending order by the associated median of the value field:

{
  "domain": {
    "data": "table",
    "field": "category",
    "sort": {"op": "median", "field": "value", "order": "descending"}
  }
}


This example sorts a multi-field domain in descending order based on the counts of each of the domain values:

{
  "domain": {
    "data": "table",
    "fields": ["category1", "category2"],
    "sort": {"op": "count", "order": "descending"}
  }
}


Note: For multi-field domains, the sort field values may not be undefined across all input data sets, and will exhibit duplicate values when drawing multiple domain values from the same data set. To avoid inaccurate sorting, the only allowed sort op values for multi-domain scales are count, min, and max. Support for min and max is available in versions ≥ 5.5.

Scale Ranges

Scale ranges can be specified in multiple ways:


  As an array literal of range values. For example, [0, 500] or ['a', 'b', 'c']. Array literals may include signal references as elements.
  A signal reference that resolves to a range value array. For example, {"signal": "myRange"}.
  A color scheme reference for a color palette. For example, {"scheme": "blueorange"}.
  For ordinal scales only, a data reference for a set of distinct field values. For example, {"data": "table", "field": "value"}.
  For band and point scales only, a step size for each range band. For example, {"step": 20}.
  A string indicating a pre-defined scale range default. For example, "width", "symbol", or "diverging".


Scale Range Defaults

Scale ranges can also accept string literals that map to default values. Default values can be modified, and new named defaults can be added, by using custom config settings.


  
    
      Value
      Description
    
  
  
    
      "width"
      A spatial range determined by the value of the width signal.
    
    
      "height"
      A spatial range determined by the value of the height signal. The direction of the range (top-to-bottom or bottom-to-top) is automatically determined according to the scale type.
    
    
      "symbol"
      The default plotting symbol set to use for shape encodings.
    
    
      "category"
      The default categorical color scheme to use for nominal data.
    
    
      "diverging"
      The default diverging color scheme to use for quantitative data.
    
    
      "ordinal"
      The default sequential color scheme to use for ordinal data.

      The default sequential color scheme to use for quantitative data.
    
    
      "heatmap"
      The default sequential color scheme to use for quantitative heatmaps.\nScales map data values (numbers, dates, categories, etc.) to visual values (pixels, colors, sizes). Scales are a fundamental building block of data visualization, as they determine the nature of visual encodings. Vega includes a range of scales for both continuous and discrete input data, and supports mappings for position, shape, size and color encodings.\nTo visualize scales, Vega specifications may include axes or legends. For more about supported color encodings, see the color scheme reference. Internally, Vega uses the scales provided by the d3-scale library; for more background see Introducing d3-scale by Mike Bostock.\ncolor scheme reference\nDocumentation Overview\nProperties shared across scale types.\nRequired.

The domainMin property is only intended for use with scales having continuous domains.\nInserts a single mid-point value into a two-element domain. The mid-point value must lie between the domain minimum and maximum values. This property can be useful for setting a midpoint for diverging color scales. The domainMid property is only intended for use with scales supporting continuous, piecewise domains.\ndiverging color scales\nAn array of raw values that, if non-null, directly overrides the domain property. This is useful for supporting interactions such as panning or zooming a scale. The scale may be initially determined using a data-driven domain, then modified in response to user input by setting the rawDomain value.\nThe interpolation method for range values. By default, continuous scales use a general interpolator for numbers, dates, strings and colors (in RGB space) is used. For color ranges, this property allows interpolation in alternative color spaces. Legal values include rgb, hsl, hsl-long, lab, hcl, hcl-long, cubehelix and cubehelix-long (‘-long’ variants use longer paths in polar coordinate spaces). If object-valued, this property accepts an object with a string-valued type property and an optional numeric gamma property applicable to rgb and cubehelix interpolators. For more, see the d3-interpolate documentation.\nd3-interpolate documentation\nThe range of the scale, representing the set of visual values. For numeric values, the range typically takes the form of a two-element array with minimum and maximum values. For ordinal or quantized data, the range may be an array of desired output values, which are mapped to elements in the specified domain.

This method typically modifies the scale’s domain, and may only extend the bounds to the nearest round value. Nicing is useful if the domain is computed from data and may be irregular. For example, for a domain of [0.201479…, 0.996679…], a nice domain might be [0.2, 1.0]. Domain values set via domainMin and domainMax (but not domainRaw) are subject to nicing. Using a number value for this parameter (representing a desired tick count) allows greater control over the step size used to extend the bounds, guaranteeing that the returned ticks will exactly cover the domain.\nBoolean flag indicating if the scale domain should include zero. The default value is true for linear, sqrt and pow, and false otherwise.\nLinear scales (linear) are quantitative scales scales that preserve proportional differences. Each range value y can be expressed as a linear function of the domain value x: y = mx + b.\nLog scales (log) are quantitative scales scales in which a logarithmic transform is applied to the input domain value before the output range value is computed. Log scales are particularly useful for plotting data that varies over multiple orders of magnitude. The mapping to the range value y can be expressed as a logarithmic function of the domain value x: y = m log(x) + b.\nAs log(0) = -∞, a log scale domain must be strictly-positive or strictly-negative; the domain must not include or cross zero. A log scale with a positive domain has a well-defined behavior for positive values, and a log scale with a negative domain has a well-defined behavior for negative values. (For a negative domain, input and output values are implicitly multiplied by -1.) The behavior of the scale is undefined if you run a negative value through a log scale with a positive domain or vice versa.\nThe base of the logarithm (default 10).\nPower scales (pow) are quantitative scales scales that apply an exponential transform to the input domain value before the output range value is computed. Each range value y can be expressed as a polynomial function of the domain value x: y = mx^k + b, where k is the exponent value. Power scales also support negative domain values, in which case the input value and the resulting output value are multiplied by -1.\nThe exponent to use in the scale transform (default 1).\nSquare root (sqrt) scales are a convenient shorthand for power scales with an exponent of 0.5, indicating a square root transform.\nSymmetric Log Scales ≥ 5.0\nSymmetric log scales (symlog) are quantitative scales scales that provide scaling similar to log scales, but supports non-positive numbers. Symlog scales are particularly useful for plotting data that varies over multiple orders of magnitude but includes negative- or zero-valued data. For more, see “A bi-symmetric log transformation for wide-range data” by Webber for more.\n“A bi-symmetric log transformation for wide-range data”\nA constant determining the slope of the symlog function around zero (default 1).\nTime scales (time and utc) are quantitative scales with a temporal domain: values in the input domain are assumed to be Date objects or timestamps. The time scale type uses the current local timezone setting. UTC scales (utc) instead use Coordinated Universal Time. Both time and utc scales use a default domain of [2000-01-01, 2000-01-02], and a default unit range [0, 1].\nCoordinated Universal Time\nString | Object | Number | Boolean\nIf specified, modifies the scale domain to use a more human-friendly value range. For time and utc scale types, the nice value can additionally be a string indicating the desired time interval. Legal values are "millisecond", "second", "minute", "hour", "day", "week", "month", and "year". Alternatively, time and utc scales can accept an object-valued interval specifier of the form {"interval": "month", "step": 3}, which includes a desired number of interval steps. Here, the domain would snap to quarter (Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct) boundaries.\nSequential Scales (Deprecated)\nSequential scales (sequential) are similar to linear scales, but use a fixed interpolator to determine the output range. As of Vega 5.0, sequential scales are deprecated: specifications should now use a linear (or log, etc.) scale with a color-valued range, rather than  a sequential scale.\nA boolean indicating if output values should be clamped to the range (default false). If clamping is disabled and the scale is passed a value outside the domain, the scale may return a value outside the range through extrapolation. If clamping is enabled, the output value of the scale is always within the scale’s range.\nSets the maximum value in the scale domain, overriding the domain property.\nSets the minimum value in the scale domain, overriding the domain property.\nInserts a single mid-point value into a two-element domain. The mid-point value must lie between the domain minimum and maximum values. This property can be useful for setting a midpoint for diverging color scales.\ndiverging color scales\nRequired. The range value should either be a color scheme object or an array of color strings. If an array of colors is provided, the array will be used to create a continuous interpolator via linear interpolation in the RGB color space.\nBack to scale type reference\nBack to scale type reference\nDiscrete scales map values from a discrete domain to a discrete range. In the case of band and point scales, the range is determined by discretizing a continuous numeric range.\nOrdinal scales (ordinal) have a discrete domain and range. For example, an ordinal scale might map a set of named categories to a set of colors, or to a set of shapes. Ordinal scales function as a “lookup table” from a domain value to a range value.\nThis example uses an ordinal scale for color-coded categories, with up to 20 unique colors:\n{
  "scales": [
    {
      "name": "color",
      "type": "ordinal",
      "domain": {"data": "table", "field": "category"},
      "range": {"scheme": "category20"}
    }
  ]
}\n{
  "scales": [
    {
      "name": "color",
      "type": "ordinal",
      "domain": {"data": "table", "field": "category"},
      "range": {"scheme": "category20"}
    }
  ]
}\nBand scales (band) accept a discrete domain similar to ordinal scales, but map this domain to a continuous, numeric output range such as pixels. Discrete output values are automatically computed by the scale by dividing the continuous range into uniform bands. Band scales are typically used for bar charts with an ordinal or categorical dimension.\nIn addition to a standard numerical range value (such as [0, 500]), band scales can be given a fixed step size for each band. The actual range is then determined by both the step size and the cardinality (element count) of the input domain. The step size is specified by an object with a step property that provides the step size in pixels, for example "range": {"step": 20}.\nThis image from the d3-scale documentation illustrates how a band scale works:\nd3-scale documentation\nThe alignment of elements within the scale range. This value must lie in the range [0,1]. A value of 0.5 (default) indicates that the bands should be centered within the range. A value of 0 or 1 may be used to shift the bands to one side, say to position them adjacent to an axis. For more, see this explainer for D3 band align.\nthis explainer for D3 band align\nA boolean flag (default false) indicating if an ordinal domain should be implicitly extended with new values. If false, the scale will return undefined for values not explicitly included in the domain. If true, new values will be appended to the domain and the matching range value will be returned.\nSets paddingInner and paddingOuter to the same padding value (default 0). This value must lie in the range [0,1].\nThe inner padding (spacing) within each band step, as a fraction of the step size (default 0). This value must lie in the range [0,1].\nThe outer padding (spacing) at the ends of the scale range, as a fraction of the step size (default 0). This value must lie in the range [0,1].\nPoint scales (point) are a variant of band scales where the internal band width is fixed to zero. Point scales are typically used for scatterplots with an ordinal or categorical dimension. Similar to band scales, point scale range values may be specified using either a numerical extent ([0, 500]) or a step size ({"step": 20}). As point scales do not have internal band widths (only step sizes between bands), they do not accept the paddingInner property.\nThis image from the d3-scale documentation illustrates how a point scale works:\nd3-scale documentation\nThe alignment of elements within the scale range. This value must lie in the range [0,1]. A value of 0.5 (default) indicates that the points should be centered within the range. A value of 0 or 1 may be used to shift the points to one side, say to position them adjacent to an axis.\nAn alias for paddingOuter (default 0). This value must lie in the range [0,1].\nThe outer padding (spacing) at the ends of the scale range, as a fraction of the step size (default 0). This value must lie in the range [0,1].\nBack to scale type reference\nBack to scale type reference\nDiscretizing scales break up a continuous domain into discrete segments, and then map values in each segment to a range value.\nQuantile scales (quantile) map a sample of input domain values to a discrete range based on computed quantile boundaries. The domain is considered continuous and thus the scale will accept any reasonable input value; however, the domain is specified as a discrete set of sample values. The number of values in (i.e., the cardinality of) the output range determines the number of quantiles that will be computed from the domain. To compute the quantiles, the domain is sorted, and treated as a population of discrete values. The resulting quantile boundaries segment the domain into groups with roughly equal numbers of sample points per group.\nQuantile scales are particularly useful for creating color or size encodings with a fixed number of output values. Using a discrete set of encoding levels (typically between 5-9 colors or sizes) sometimes supports more accurate perceptual comparison than a continuous range. For related functionality see quantize scales, which partition the domain into uniform domain extents, rather than groups with equal element counts. Quantile scales have the benefit of evenly distributing data points to encoded values. In contrast, quantize scales uniformly segment the input domain and provide no guarantee on how data points will be distributed among the output visual values.\nThis example color-codes quantile values in five groups, using colors sampled from a continuous color scheme:\n{
  "name": "color",
  "scale": "quantile",
  "domain": {"data": "table", "field": "value"},
  "range": {"scheme": "plasma", "count": 5}
}\n{
  "name": "color",
  "scale": "quantile",
  "domain": {"data": "table", "field": "value"},
  "range": {"scheme": "plasma", "count": 5}
}\nQuantize scales (quantize) are similar to linear scales, except they use a discrete rather than continuous range. The continuous input domain is divided into uniform segments based on the number of values in (i.e., the cardinality of) the output range. Each range value y can be expressed as a quantized linear function of the domain value x: y = m round(x) + b.\nQuantize scales are particularly useful for creating color or size encodings with a fixed number of output values. Using a discrete set of encoding levels (typically between 5-9 colors or sizes) sometimes supports more accurate perceptual comparison than a continuous range. For related functionality see quantile scales, which partition the domain into groups with equal element counts, rather than uniform domain extents.\nExtends the domain so that it starts and ends on nice round values (default false). This method typically modifies the scale’s domain, and may only extend the bounds to the nearest round value. Nicing is useful if the domain is computed from data and may be irregular. For example, for a domain of [0.201479…, 0.996679…], a nice domain might be [0.2, 1.0]. Domain values set via domainMin and domainMax (but not domainRaw) are subject to nicing. Using a number value for this parameter (representing a desired tick count) allows greater control over the step size used to extend the bounds, guaranteeing that the returned ticks will exactly cover the domain.\nBoolean flag indicating if the scale domain should include zero (default false).\nThis example color-codes a quantized domain using a 7-point color scheme:\n{
  "name": "color",
  "scale": "quantize",
  "domain": {"data": "table", "field": "value"},
  "range": {"scheme": "blues", "count": 7}
}\n{
  "name": "color",
  "scale": "quantize",
  "domain": {"data": "table", "field": "value"},
  "range": {"scheme": "blues", "count": 7}
}\nThreshold scales (threshold) are similar to quantize scales, except they allow mapping of arbitrary subsets of the domain (not uniform segments) to discrete values in the range. The input domain is still continuous, and divided into slices based on a set of threshold values provided to the domain property. The range property must have N+1 elements, where N is the number of threshold boundaries provided in the domain.\nGiven the following scale definition,\n{
  "name": "threshold",
  "type": "threshold",
  "domain": [0, 1],
  "range": ["red", "white", "blue"]
}\n{
  "name": "threshold",
  "type": "threshold",
  "domain": [0, 1],
  "range": ["red", "white", "blue"]
}\nthe scale will map domain values to color strings as follows:\n-1   => "red"
0    => "white"
0.5  => "white"
1.0  => "blue"
1000 => "blue"\n-1   => "red"
0    => "white"
0.5  => "white"
1.0  => "blue"
1000 => "blue"\nBinned ordinal scales (bin-ordinal) are a special type of ordinal scale for use with data that has been subdivided into bins (for example, using Vega’s bin transform). The main benefit of using bin-ordinal scales is that they provide “bin-aware” routines for sampling values and generating labels for inclusion in legends. They are particularly useful for creating binned color encodings.\nThe domain values for a binned ordinal scale must be the set of all bin boundaries, from the minimum bin start to maximum bin end. Input domain values are discretized to the appropriate bin, which is then treated as a standard ordinal scale input. However, as the domain property only accepts an array of values, the bin-ordinal scale provides a bins property that also accepts a bin specification and can be used instead of an explicit domain property.\n≥ 5.0 Bin boundaries over the scale domain, such as those computed by Vega’s bin transform. This property can be either an explicit array of bin boundary values or a specification object, see the scale bins reference for more. If the domain property is not defined, bins will be used to determine the scale domain.\nHere is an example of a bin-ordinal scale defined in conjunction with a bin transform:\n{
  "data": [
    {
      "name": "input",
      "transform": [
        { "type": "extent", "field": "value", "signal": "extent" },
        { "type": "bin", "extent": {"signal": "extent"}, "signal": "bins" }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "scales": [
    {
      "name": "color",
      "type": "bin-ordinal",
      "bins": {"signal": "bins"},
      "range": {"scheme": "greens"}
    }
  ]
}\n{
  "data": [
    {
      "name": "input",
      "transform": [
        { "type": "extent", "field": "value", "signal": "extent" },
        { "type": "bin", "extent": {"signal": "extent"}, "signal": "bins" }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "scales": [
    {
      "name": "color",
      "type": "bin-ordinal",
      "bins": {"signal": "bins"},
      "range": {"scheme": "greens"}
    }
  ]
}\nBack to scale type reference\nBack to scale type reference\nBin boundaries can be provided to scales as either an explicit array of bin boundaries or as a bin specification object. The legal values are:\nA signal reference that resolves to either an array or bin specification object.\nAn array literal of bin boundary values. For example, [0, 5, 10, 15, 20]. The array must include both starting and ending boundaries. The previous example uses five values to indicate a total of four bin intervals: [0-5), [5-10), [10-15), [15-20]. Array literals may include signal references as elements.\nA bin specification object that indicates the bin step size, and optionally the start and stop boundaries. The output value of a bin transform is a valid bin specification object.\nThe starting (lowest-valued) bin boundary. If not defined, the lowest value of the scale domain will be used.\nThe stopping (highest-valued) bin boundary. If not defined, the highest value of the scale domain will be used.\nRequired. The step size defining the bin interval width.\nScale domains can be specified in multiple ways:\nAs an array literal of domain values. For example, [0, 500] or ['a', 'b', 'c']. Array literals may include signal references as elements.\nA signal reference that resolves to a domain value array. For example, {"signal": "myDomain"}.\nA data reference object that specifies field values in one or more data sets.\nA basic data reference indicates a data set, field name, and optional sorting for discrete scales:\nRequired. The name of the data set containing domain values.\nRequired. The name of the data field (e.g., "price").\nIf a boolean true value, sort the domain values in ascending order. If object-valued, sort the domain according to the provided sort parameters. Sorting is only supported for discrete scale types.\nFor example, "domain": {"data": "table", "field": "value"}, derives a scale domain from the value field of data objects in the table data set. If the scale type is quantitative or a quantize, the derived domain will be a two-element [min, max] array. If the scale type is discrete, the derived domain will be an array of all distinct values. If the scale type is quantile, all values will be used to compute quantile boundaries.\nMulti-Field Data References\nScale domains can also be derived using values from multiple fields. Multiple fields from the same data set can be specified by replacing the field property with a fields property that takes an array of field names:\nRequired. The name of the data set containing domain values.\nRequired. The names of the data field (e.g., ["price", "cost"]).\nIf a boolean true value, sort the domain values in ascending order. If object-valued, sort the domain according to the provided sort parameters. Sorting is only supported for discrete scale types.\nMore generally, scale domains may also use values pulled from different data sets. In this case, the domain object should have a fields property, which is an array of basic data references:\nRequired. An array of basic data references indicating each data set and field value to include in the domain. In addition, array literals (e.g., [0, 100], ["a", "b", "c"]) may be included as elements of the fields array for inclusion in the domain determination.\nIf a boolean true value, sort the domain values in ascending order. If object-valued, sort the domain according to the provided sort parameters. Sorting is only supported for discrete scale types.\nHere is an example that constructs a domain using the fields price and cost drawn from two different data sets:\n"domain": {
  "fields": [
    {"data": "table1", "field": "price"},
    {"data": "table2", "field": "cost"}
   ]
}\n"domain": {
  "fields": [
    {"data": "table1", "field": "price"},
    {"data": "table2", "field": "cost"}
   ]
}\nThe sort property of a domain data reference can accept, in addition to a simple boolean, an object-valued sort definition:\nThe data field to sort by. If unspecified, defaults to the field specified in the outer data reference.\nAn aggregate operation to perform on the field prior to sorting. Examples include count, mean and median. This property is required in cases where the sort field and the data reference field do not match. The input data objects will be aggregated, grouped by data reference field values. For a full list of operations, see the aggregate transform, and also see below for limitations with multi-field domains.\nThe sort order. One of ascending (default) or descending.\nThis example sorts distinct category field values in descending order by the associated median of the value field:\n{
  "domain": {
    "data": "table",
    "field": "category",
    "sort": {"op": "median", "field": "value", "order": "descending"}
  }
}\n{
  "domain": {
    "data": "table",
    "field": "category",
    "sort": {"op": "median", "field": "value", "order": "descending"}
  }
}\nThis example sorts a multi-field domain in descending order based on the counts of each of the domain values:\n{
  "domain": {
    "data": "table",
    "fields": ["category1", "category2"],
    "sort": {"op": "count", "order": "descending"}
  }
}\n{
  "domain": {
    "data": "table",
    "fields": ["category1", "category2"],
    "sort": {"op": "count", "order": "descending"}
  }
}\nNote: For multi-field domains, the sort field values may not be undefined across all input data sets, and will exhibit duplicate values when drawing multiple domain values from the same data set. To avoid inaccurate sorting, the only allowed sort op values for multi-domain scales are count, min, and max. Support for min and max is available in versions ≥ 5.5.\nScale ranges can be specified in multiple ways:\nAs an array literal of range values. For example, [0, 500] or ['a', 'b', 'c']. Array literals may include signal references as elements.\nA signal reference that resolves to a range value array. For example, {"signal": "myRange"}.\nA color scheme reference for a color palette. For example, {"scheme": "blueorange"}.\ncolor scheme reference\nFor ordinal scales only, a data reference for a set of distinct field values. For example, {"data": "table", "field": "value"}.\nFor band and point scales only, a step size for each range band. For example, {"step": 20}.\nA string indicating a pre-defined scale range default. For example, "width", "symbol", or "diverging".\nScale ranges can also accept string literals that map to default values. Default values can be modified, and new named defaults can be added, by using custom config settings.\nA spatial range determined by the value of the width signal.\nA spatial range determined by the value of the height signal. The direction of the range (top-to-bottom or bottom-to-top) is automatically determined according to the scale type.\nThe default plotting symbol set to use for shape encodings.\nThe default categorical color scheme to use for nominal data.\ncategorical color scheme\nThe default diverging color scheme to use for quantitative data.\ndiverging color scheme\nThe default sequential color scheme to use for ordinal data.\nsequential color scheme\nThe default sequential color scheme to use for quantitative data.\nsequential color scheme\nThe default sequential color scheme to use for quantitative heatmaps.\nsequential color scheme\n\n\nVega

    Projections
    Cartographic projections map (longitude, latitude) pairs to projected (x, y) coordinates. Vega uses projections to layout both geographic points (such as locations on a map) for which longitude and latitude coordinates are part of the input data, and geographic regions (such as countries and states) represented using the GeoJSON format.

Projection Properties


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      name
      String
      Required. A unique name for the projection. Projections and scales share the same namespace; names must be unique across both.
    
    
      type
      String
      The cartographic projection to use. The default is "mercator". This value is case-insensitive, for example "albers" and "Albers" indicate the same projection type.
    
    
      clipAngle
      Number
      The projection’s clipping circle radius, specified as an angle in degrees. If null, switches to antimeridian cutting rather than small-circle clipping.
    
    
      clipExtent
      Array
      The projection’s viewport clip extent, as a set of pixel bounds. The extent bounds are specified as an array [[x0, y0], [x1, y1]], where x0 is the left-side of the viewport, y0 is the top, x1 is the right and y1 is the bottom. If null, no viewport clipping is performed.
    
    
      scale
      Number
      The projection’s scale factor. The default scale is projection-specific. The scale factor corresponds linearly to the distance between projected points; however, scale factor values are not equivalent across projections.
    
    
      translate
      Number[ ]
      The projection’s translation offset as a two-element array [tx, ty]. If translate is not specified, returns the current translation offset which defaults to [480, 250]. The translation offset determines the pixel coordinates of the projection’s center. The default translation offset places (0°,0°) at the center of a 960×500 area.
    
    
      center
      Number[ ]
      The projection’s center, a two-element array of longitude and latitude in degrees. The default value is [0, 0].
    
    
      rotate
      Number[ ]
      The projection’s three-axis rotation angles. The value must be a two- or three-element array of numbers [lambda, phi, gamma] specifying the rotation angles in degrees about each spherical axis. (These correspond to yaw, pitch and roll.) The default value is [0, 0, 0].
    
    
      parallels
      Number[ ]
      For conic projections, the two standard parallels that define the map layout. The default depends on the specific conic projection used.
    
    
      pointRadius
      Number
      The default radius (in pixels) to use when drawing GeoJSON Point and MultiPoint geometries. This parameter sets a constant default value. To modify the point radius in response to data, see the corresponding parameter of the GeoPath and GeoShape transforms. The default value is 4.5.
    
    
      precision
      Number
      The threshold for the projection’s adaptive resampling in pixels. This value corresponds to the Douglas–Peucker distance. If precision is not specified, returns the projection’s current resampling precision which defaults to √0.5 ≅ 0.70710…
    
    
      fit
      Object | Array
      GeoJSON data to which the projection should attempt to automatically fit the translate and scale parameters. If object-valued, this parameter should be a GeoJSON Feature or FeatureCollection. If array-valued, each array member may be a GeoJSON Feature, FeatureCollection, or a sub-array of GeoJSON Features.
    
    
      extent
      Array[ ]
      Used in conjunction with fit, provides the pixel area to which the projection should be automatically fit. The extent bounds are specified as an array [[x0, y0], [x1, y1]], where x0 is the left side of the extent, y0 is the top, x1 is the right and y1 is the bottom.
    
    
      size
      Number[ ]
      Used in conjunction with fit, provides the width and height in pixels of the area to which the projection should be automatically fit. This parameter is equivalent to an extent of [[0,0], size].
    
  


In addition to the shared properties above, the following properties are supported for specific projection types in the d3-geo-projection library:
coefficient,
distance,
fraction,
lobes,
parallel,
radius,
ratio,
spacing,
tilt.

Alternative default values for any of the properties above can be set using a custom config object.

Register Additional Projections

Vega can be extended with additional projections, such as those found in the d3-geo-projection library.

To register all extended projections from d3-geo-projection with Vega, simply import the vega-projection-extended library:

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega-projection-extended@2"></script>


Alternatively, custom projections can be manually registered using the vega.projection method:

// Assumes d3-geo-projection is imported under the d3 variable.
// To register with Vega, provide a name and projection function.
vega.projection('winkel3', d3.geoWinkel3);

// Vega parser and runtime now support the 'winkel3' projection
var runtime = vega.parse({
  ...,
  "projections": [
    { "name": "proj", "type": "winkel3" }

    Projections
    Cartographic projections map (longitude, latitude) pairs to projected (x, y) coordinates. Vega uses projections to layout both geographic points (such as locations on a map) for which longitude and latitude coordinates are part of the input data, and geographic regions (such as countries and states) represented using the GeoJSON format.

Projection Properties


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      name
      String
      Required. A unique name for the projection. Projections and scales share the same namespace; names must be unique across both.
    
    
      type
      String
      The cartographic projection to use. The default is "mercator". This value is case-insensitive, for example "albers" and "Albers" indicate the same projection type.
    
    
      clipAngle
      Number
      The projection’s clipping circle radius, specified as an angle in degrees. If null, switches to antimeridian cutting rather than small-circle clipping.
    
    
      clipExtent
      Array
      The projection’s viewport clip extent, as a set of pixel bounds. The extent bounds are specified as an array [[x0, y0], [x1, y1]], where x0 is the left-side of the viewport, y0 is the top, x1 is the right and y1 is the bottom. If null, no viewport clipping is performed.
    
    
      scale
      Number
      The projection’s scale factor. The default scale is projection-specific. The scale factor corresponds linearly to the distance between projected points; however, scale factor values are not equivalent across projections.
    
    
      translate
      Number[ ]
      The projection’s translation offset as a two-element array [tx, ty]. If translate is not specified, returns the current translation offset which defaults to [480, 250]. The translation offset determines the pixel coordinates of the projection’s center. The default translation offset places (0°,0°) at the center of a 960×500 area.
    
    
      center
      Number[ ]
      The projection’s center, a two-element array of longitude and latitude in degrees. The default value is [0, 0].
    
    
      rotate
      Number[ ]
      The projection’s three-axis rotation angles. The value must be a two- or three-element array of numbers [lambda, phi, gamma] specifying the rotation angles in degrees about each spherical axis. (These correspond to yaw, pitch and roll.) The default value is [0, 0, 0].
    
    
      parallels
      Number[ ]
      For conic projections, the two standard parallels that define the map layout. The default depends on the specific conic projection used.
    
    
      pointRadius
      Number
      The default radius (in pixels) to use when drawing GeoJSON Point and MultiPoint geometries. This parameter sets a constant default value. To modify the point radius in response to data, see the corresponding parameter of the GeoPath and GeoShape transforms. The default value is 4.5.
    
    
      precision
      Number
      The threshold for the projection’s adaptive resampling in pixels. This value corresponds to the Douglas–Peucker distance. If precision is not specified, returns the projection’s current resampling precision which defaults to √0.5 ≅ 0.70710…
    
    
      fit
      Object | Array
      GeoJSON data to which the projection should attempt to automatically fit the translate and scale parameters. If object-valued, this parameter should be a GeoJSON Feature or FeatureCollection. If array-valued, each array member may be a GeoJSON Feature, FeatureCollection, or a sub-array of GeoJSON Features.
    
    
      extent
      Array[ ]
      Used in conjunction with fit, provides the pixel area to which the projection should be automatically fit. The extent bounds are specified as an array [[x0, y0], [x1, y1]], where x0 is the left side of the extent, y0 is the top, x1 is the right and y1 is the bottom.
    
    
      size
      Number[ ]
      Used in conjunction with fit, provides the width and height in pixels of the area to which the projection should be automatically fit. This parameter is equivalent to an extent of [[0,0], size].

This property is useful for formatting date-time values for band or point scales. If specified, the format property must have a valid specifier pattern for the given type. Supported ≥ 5.1, UTC support ≥ 5.8.
    
    
      grid

      labelAngle
      Number
      Angle in degrees of axis tick labels.
    
    
      labelBaseline
      String
      Vertical text baseline of axis tick labels, overriding the default setting for the current axis orientation. One of alphabetic (default), top, middle, bottom, line-top, or line-bottom.

      labelBound
      Boolean | Number
      Indicates if labels should be hidden if they exceed the axis range. If false (the default) no bounds overlap analysis is performed. If true, labels will be hidden if they exceed the axis range by more than 1 pixel.

      Text color of axis tick labels.
    
    
      labelFlush
      Boolean | Number
      Indicates if labels at the beginning or end of the axis should be aligned flush with the scale range. If a number, indicates a pixel distance threshold: labels with anchor coordinates within the threshold distance for an axis end-point will be flush-adjusted. If true, a default threshold of 1 pixel is used. Flush alignment for a horizontal axis will left-align labels near the beginning of the axis and right-align labels near the end. For vertical axes, bottom and top text baselines will be applied instead.
    
    
      labelFlushOffset
      Number
      Indicates the number of pixels by which to offset flush-adjusted labels (default 0). For example, a value of 2 will push flush-adjusted labels 2 pixels outward from the center of the axis. Offsets can help the labels better visually group with corresponding axis ticks.
    
    
      labelFont
      String
      Font name for axis tick labels.
    
    
      labelFontSize

      Number
      Opacity of axis tick labels. ≥ 4.1
    
    
      labelOverlap
      Boolean | String
      The strategy to use for resolving overlap of axis labels. If false (the default), no overlap reduction is attempted. If set to true or "parity", a strategy of removing every other label is used (this works well for standard linear axes). If set to "greedy", a linear scan of the labels is performed, removing any label that overlaps with the last visible label (this often works better for log-scaled axes).
    
    
      labelPadding
      Number
      The padding in pixels between labels and ticks.
    
    
      labelSeparation
      Number
      The minimum separation that must be between label bounding boxes for them to be considered non-overlapping (default 0). This property is ignored if labelOverlap resolution is not enabled. ≥ 5.0
    
    
      minExtent

      The minimum extent in pixels that axis ticks and labels should use. This determines a minimum offset value for axis titles.
    
    
      maxExtent
      Number | Value
      The maximum extent in pixels that axis ticks and labels should use. This determines a maximum offset value for axis titles.
    
    
      offset
      Number | Value
      The orthogonal offset in pixels by which to displace the axis from its position along the edge of the chart.
    
    
      position
      Number | Value
      The anchor position of the axis in pixels (default 0). For x-axes with top or bottom orientation, this sets the axis group x coordinate. For y-axes with left or right orientation, this sets the axis group y coordinate.
    
    
      ticks
      Boolean
      A boolean flag indicating if ticks should be included as part of the axis (default true).
    
    
      tickBand
      String
      Indicates the type of tick style to use in conjunction with band scales. One of "center" (default) to center ticks in the middle of the band interval, or "extent" to place ticks at band extents (interval boundaries).

      A desired number of ticks, for axes visualizing quantitative scales. The resulting number may be different so that values are “nice” (multiples of 2, 5, 10) and lie within the underlying scale’s range. For scales of type time or utc, the tick count can instead be a time interval specifier. Legal string values are "millisecond", "second", "minute", "hour", "day", "week", "month", and "year". Alternatively, an object-valued interval specifier of the form {"interval": "month", "step": 3} includes a desired number of interval steps. Here, ticks are generated for each quarter (Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct) boundary.
    
    
      tickDash

      tickExtra
      Boolean
      Boolean flag indicating if an extra axis tick should be added for the initial position of the axis. This flag is useful for styling axes for band scales such that ticks are placed on band boundaries rather in the middle of a band.

      tickSize
      Number
      The length in pixels of axis ticks.
    
    
      tickWidth
      Number
      Width in pixels of axis ticks.
    
    
      title
      String | String[ ]

      titleAnchor
      String
      The anchor position for placing the axis title. One of "start", "middle", "end", or null (default, for automatic determination).

      titleAlign
      String
      Horizontal text alignment of the axis title. One of "left", "center", or "right". If specified, this value overrides automatic alignment based on the titleAnchor value.
    
    
      titleAngle
      Number
      Angle in degrees of the axis title.
    
    
      titleBaseline
      String
      Vertical text baseline of the axis title. One of alphabetic (default), top, middle, bottom, line-top, or line-bottom. The line-top and line-bottom values ≥ 5.10 operate similarly to top and bottom, but are calculated relative to the lineHeight rather than fontSize alone.

      Number
      Custom Y position of the axis title relative to the axis group, overriding the standard layout.
    
    
      translate
      Number
      Coordinate space translation offset for axis layout. By default, axes are translated by a 0.5 pixel offset for both the x and y coordinates in order to align stroked lines with the pixel grid. However, for vector graphics output these pixel-specific adjustments may be undesirable, in which case translate can be changed (for example, to zero). ≥ 5.8
    
    
      values
      Array
      Explicitly set the visible axis tick and label values. The array entries should be legal values in the backing scale domain.
    
    
      zindex
      Number
      The integer z-index indicating the layering of the axis group relative to other axis, mark, and legend groups. The default value is 0 and axes and grid lines are drawn behind any marks defined in the same specification level. Higher values (1) will cause axes and grid lines to be drawn on top of marks.
    
  


Accessibility Properties ≥ 5.11

Accessibility properties are used to determine ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes when using Vega to render SVG output.


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      aria
      Boolean
      A boolean flag (default true) indicating if ARIA attributes should be included (SVG output only). If false, the “aria-hidden” attribute will be set on the output SVG group, removing the axis from the ARIA accessibility tree.
    
    
      description
      String
      A text description of this axis for ARIA accessibility (SVG output only). If the aria property is true, for SVG output the “aria-label” attribute will be set to this description. If the description is unspecified it will be automatically generated.
    
  


Themes and Configuration

To create themes, new default values for many axis properties can be set using a config object.

Axis Orientation Reference

Valid settings for the axis orient parameter.


  
    
      Value
      Description
    
  
  
    
      left
      Place a y-axis along the left edge of the chart.
    
    
      right
      Place a y-axis along the right edge of the chart.
    
    
      top
      Place an x-axis along the top edge of the chart.

Custom Axis Encodings

Custom mark properties can be set for all axis elements using the encode parameter. The addressable elements are:


  axis for the axis group mark,
  ticks for tick rule marks,
  grid for gridline rule marks,
  labels for label text marks,
  title for the title text mark, and
  domain for the axis domain rule mark.


Each element accepts a set of visual encoding directives grouped into enter, update, exit, etc. objects as described in the Marks documentation. Mark properties can be styled using standard value references.

In addition, each encode block may include a string-valued name property to assign a unique name to the mark set, a boolean-valued interactive property to enable input event handling, and a string-valued (or array-valued) style property to apply default property values. Unless otherwise specified, title elements use a default style of "guide-title" and labels elements use a default style of "guide-label".

Each axis tick, grid line, and label instance is backed by a data object with the following fields, which may be accessed as part of a custom visual encoding rule.


  label - the string label
  value - the data value
  index - fractional tick index (0 for the first tick and 1 for the last tick)


The following example shows how to set custom colors, thickness, text angle, and fonts. The labels encoding block also make legend labels responsive to input events, and changes the text color on mouse hover.

          "strokeWidth": {"value": 1.5}
        }
      }
    }
  }
]


Custom text can be defined using the "text" property for labels. For example, one could define an ordinal scale that serves as a lookup table from axis values to axis label text.\nVega

      Opacity of axis grid lines.
    
    
      gridScale
      String
      The name of the scale to use for including grid lines. By default grid lines are driven by the same scale as the ticks and labels.

      Horizontal text alignment of axis tick labels, overriding the default setting for the current axis orientation.
    
    
      labelAngle
      Number
      Angle in degrees of axis tick labels.
    
    
      labelBaseline
      String
      Vertical text baseline of axis tick labels, overriding the default setting for the current axis orientation. One of alphabetic (default), top, middle, bottom, line-top, or line-bottom.

      labelBound
      Boolean | Number
      Indicates if labels should be hidden if they exceed the axis range. If false (the default) no bounds overlap analysis is performed.

      Text color of axis tick labels.
    
    
      labelFlush
      Boolean | Number
      Indicates if labels at the beginning or end of the axis should be aligned flush with the scale range. If a number, indicates a pixel distance threshold: labels with anchor coordinates within the threshold distance for an axis end-point will be flush-adjusted. If true, a default threshold of 1 pixel is used. Flush alignment for a horizontal axis will left-align labels near the beginning of the axis and right-align labels near the end. For vertical axes, bottom and top text baselines will be applied instead.
    
    
      labelFlushOffset
      Number
      Indicates the number of pixels by which to offset flush-adjusted labels (default 0). For example, a value of 2 will push flush-adjusted labels 2 pixels outward from the center of the axis. Offsets can help the labels better visually group with corresponding axis ticks.

      labelOverlap
      Boolean | String
      The strategy to use for resolving overlap of axis labels. If false (the default), no overlap reduction is attempted. If set to true or "parity", a strategy of removing every other label is used (this works well for standard linear axes). If set to "greedy", a linear scan of the labels is performed, removing any label that overlaps with the last visible label (this often works better for log-scaled axes).
    
    
      labelPadding

      The padding in pixels between labels and ticks.
    
    
      labelSeparation

      The minimum extent in pixels that axis ticks and labels should use. This determines a minimum offset value for axis titles.
    
    
      maxExtent
      Number | Value
      The maximum extent in pixels that axis ticks and labels should use. This determines a maximum offset value for axis titles.
    
    
      offset
      Number | Value
      The orthogonal offset in pixels by which to displace the axis from its position along the edge of the chart.
    
    
      position
      Number | Value
      The anchor position of the axis in pixels (default 0). For x-axes with top or bottom orientation, this sets the axis group x coordinate. For y-axes with left or right orientation, this sets the axis group y coordinate.

The resulting number may be different so that values are “nice” (multiples of 2, 5, 10) and lie within the underlying scale’s range. For scales of type time or utc, the tick count can instead be a time interval specifier. Legal string values are "millisecond", "second", "minute", "hour", "day", "week", "month", and "year". Alternatively, an object-valued interval specifier of the form {"interval": "month", "step": 3} includes a desired number of interval steps. Here, ticks are generated for each quarter (Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct) boundary.
    
    
      tickDash

      tickSize
      Number
      The length in pixels of axis ticks.
    
    
      tickWidth
      Number
      Width in pixels of axis ticks.
    
    
      title

      titleAnchor
      String
      The anchor position for placing the axis title. One of "start", "middle", "end", or null (default, for automatic determination).

      Number
      Angle in degrees of the axis title.
    
    
      titleBaseline
      String
      Vertical text baseline of the axis title. One of alphabetic (default), top, middle, bottom, line-top, or line-bottom. The line-top and line-bottom values ≥ 5.10 operate similarly to top and bottom, but are calculated relative to the lineHeight rather than fontSize alone.

      translate
      Number
      Coordinate space translation offset for axis layout. By default, axes are translated by a 0.5 pixel offset for both the x and y coordinates in order to align stroked lines with the pixel grid. However, for vector graphics output these pixel-specific adjustments may be undesirable, in which case translate can be changed (for example, to zero). ≥ 5.8
    
    
      values
      Array
      Explicitly set the visible axis tick and label values. The array entries should be legal values in the backing scale domain.
    
    
      zindex
      Number
      The integer z-index indicating the layering of the axis group relative to other axis, mark, and legend groups. The default value is 0 and axes and grid lines are drawn behind any marks defined in the same specification level. Higher values (1) will cause axes and grid lines to be drawn on top of marks.
    
  


Accessibility Properties ≥ 5.11

Accessibility properties are used to determine ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes when using Vega to render SVG output.


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      aria
      Boolean
      A boolean flag (default true) indicating if ARIA attributes should be included (SVG output only). If false, the “aria-hidden” attribute will be set on the output SVG group, removing the axis from the ARIA accessibility tree.
    
    
      description
      String
      A text description of this axis for ARIA accessibility (SVG output only). If the aria property is true, for SVG output the “aria-label” attribute will be set to this description. If the description is unspecified it will be automatically generated.
    
  


Themes and Configuration

To create themes, new default values for many axis properties can be set using a config object.

Custom Axis Encodings

Custom mark properties can be set for all axis elements using the encode parameter. The addressable elements are:


  axis for the axis group mark,
  ticks for tick rule marks,
  grid for gridline rule marks,
  labels for label text marks,
  title for the title text mark, and
  domain for the axis domain rule mark.


Each element accepts a set of visual encoding directives grouped into enter, update, exit, etc. objects as described in the Marks documentation. Mark properties can be styled using standard value references.

In addition, each encode block may include a string-valued name property to assign a unique name to the mark set, a boolean-valued interactive property to enable input event handling, and a string-valued (or array-valued) style property to apply default property values. Unless otherwise specified, title elements use a default style of "guide-title" and labels elements use a default style of "guide-label".

Each axis tick, grid line, and label instance is backed by a data object with the following fields, which may be accessed as part of a custom visual encoding rule.


  label - the string label
  value - the data value
  index - fractional tick index (0 for the first tick and 1 for the last tick)


The following example shows how to set custom colors, thickness, text angle, and fonts. The labels encoding block also make legend labels responsive to input events, and changes the text color on mouse hover.

Custom text can be defined using the "text" property for labels. For example, one could define an ordinal scale that serves as a lookup table from axis values to axis label text.\nAxes visualize spatial scale mappings using ticks, grid lines and labels.

If a number, indicates a pixel distance threshold: labels with anchor coordinates within the threshold distance for an axis end-point will be flush-adjusted. If true, a default threshold of 1 pixel is used. Flush alignment for a horizontal axis will left-align labels near the beginning of the axis and right-align labels near the end. For vertical axes, bottom and top text baselines will be applied instead.\nIndicates the number of pixels by which to offset flush-adjusted labels (default 0).

    Legends
    Legends visualize scale mappings for visual values such as color, shape and size. Similar to scales and axes, legends can be defined either at the top-level visualization, or within the scope of a group mark.

Legend Properties

Properties for specifying a legend. Legends accept one or more scales as parameters. At least one of the size, shape, fill, stroke, strokeDash, or opacity properties must be specified. If multiple scales are provided, they must share the same domain of input vales. Otherwise, the behavior of the legend is undefined.

      tickMinStep
      Number
      The minimum desired step between tick values for quantitative legends, in terms of scale domain values. For example, a value of 1 indicates that ticks should not be less than 1 unit apart.

Accessibility Properties ≥ 5.11

Accessibility properties are used to determine ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes when using Vega to render SVG output.


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      aria
      Boolean
      A boolean flag (default true) indicating if ARIA attributes should be included (SVG output only). If false, the “aria-hidden” attribute will be set on the output SVG group, removing the legend from the ARIA accessibility tree.
    
    
      description
      String
      A text description of this legend for ARIA accessibility (SVG output only). If the aria property is true, for SVG output the “aria-label” attribute will be set to this description. If the description is unspecified it will be automatically generated.
    
  


Themes and Configuration

To create themes, new default values for legend properties can be set using a config object. The config object also supports customized layout behavior for collections of legends with the same orient value.

Legend Orientation Reference

Valid settings for the legend orient parameter.


  
    
      Value
      Description
    
  
  
    
      left
      Place the legend to the left of the chart.
    
    
      right
      Place the legend to the right of the chart.
    
    
      top
      Place the legend above the top of the chart.
    
    
      bottom
      Place the legend below the bottom of the chart.
    
    
      top-left
      Place the legend inside the upper left corner of the chart.
    
    
      top-right
      Place the legend inside the upper right corner of the chart.
    
    
      bottom-left
      Place the legend inside the lower left corner of the chart.
    
    
      bottom-right
      Place the legend inside the lower right corner of the chart.
    
    
      none
      Do not perform automatic layout. Allows custom layout by setting the legendX and legendY properties of the legend.
    
  


Multiple legends: If multiple legends have a left or right orientation, they will be vertically ordered by default. If multiple legends have a top or bottom orientation, they will be horizontally ordered by default. In all other cases, legends will be drawn on top of each other when placed in the same location. The multiple legend layout can be customized by setting the legend layout config.

Legend offset: In the case of left, right, top and bottom orientation, the offset parameter determines how far away the legend is placed from the rest of the chart. If the orientation is none, the offset parameter is ignored. For all other settings, the offset determines the distance the legend is moved inward from a corner of the data rectangle.

Custom Legend Encodings

Custom mark properties can be set for all legend elements using the encode parameter. The addressable elements are:


  legend for the legend group mark,
  title for the title text mark,
  labels for label text marks,
  symbols for legend symbol marks,
  entries for symbol legend group marks containing a symbol / label pair, and
  gradient for a gradient rect marks: one rect with gradient fill for continuous gradient legends, multiple rect marks with solid fill for discrete gradient legends.


Each element accepts a set of visual encoding directives grouped into enter, update, exit, etc. objects as described in the Marks documentation. Mark properties can be styled using standard value references.

In addition, each encode block may include a string-valued name property to assign a unique name to the mark set, a boolean-valued interactive property to enable input event handling, and a string-valued (or array-valued) style property to apply default property values. Unless otherwise specified, title elements use a default style of "guide-title" and labels elements use a default style of "guide-label".

Each legend symbol and label instance is backed by a data object with the following fields, which may be accessed as part of a custom visual encoding rule:


  index - an integer index
  label - the string label
  value - the data value
  size - the symbol size (for symbol legends only)


The following example shows how to set custom fonts and a border on a legend for a fill color encoding. The labels encoding block also make legend labels responsive to input events, and changes the text color on mouse hover.

Custom text can be defined using the text property for labels. For example, one could define an ordinal scale that serves as a lookup table from a backing value to legend label text. Note: to perform custom positioning when orient is none, use the top-level legendX and legendY properties, do not use x and y properties within a custom encoding block.\nVega

    Legends
    Legends visualize scale mappings for visual values such as color, shape and size. Similar to scales and axes, legends can be defined either at the top-level visualization, or within the scope of a group mark.

Legend Properties

Properties for specifying a legend. Legends accept one or more scales as parameters. At least one of the size, shape, fill, stroke, strokeDash, or opacity properties must be specified. If multiple scales are provided, they must share the same domain of input vales. Otherwise, the behavior of the legend is undefined.

Accessibility Properties ≥ 5.11

Accessibility properties are used to determine ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes when using Vega to render SVG output.


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      aria
      Boolean
      A boolean flag (default true) indicating if ARIA attributes should be included (SVG output only). If false, the “aria-hidden” attribute will be set on the output SVG group, removing the legend from the ARIA accessibility tree.
    
    
      description
      String
      A text description of this legend for ARIA accessibility (SVG output only). If the aria property is true, for SVG output the “aria-label” attribute will be set to this description. If the description is unspecified it will be automatically generated.
    
  


Themes and Configuration

To create themes, new default values for legend properties can be set using a config object. The config object also supports customized layout behavior for collections of legends with the same orient value.

Legend Orientation Reference

Valid settings for the legend orient parameter.


  
    
      Value
      Description
    
  
  
    
      left
      Place the legend to the left of the chart.
    
    
      right
      Place the legend to the right of the chart.
    
    
      top
      Place the legend above the top of the chart.
    
    
      bottom
      Place the legend below the bottom of the chart.
    
    
      top-left
      Place the legend inside the upper left corner of the chart.
    
    
      top-right
      Place the legend inside the upper right corner of the chart.
    
    
      bottom-left
      Place the legend inside the lower left corner of the chart.
    
    
      bottom-right
      Place the legend inside the lower right corner of the chart.
    
    
      none
      Do not perform automatic layout. Allows custom layout by setting the legendX and legendY properties of the legend.
    
  


Multiple legends: If multiple legends have a left or right orientation, they will be vertically ordered by default. If multiple legends have a top or bottom orientation, they will be horizontally ordered by default. In all other cases, legends will be drawn on top of each other when placed in the same location. The multiple legend layout can be customized by setting the legend layout config.

Legend offset: In the case of left, right, top and bottom orientation, the offset parameter determines how far away the legend is placed from the rest of the chart. If the orientation is none, the offset parameter is ignored. For all other settings, the offset determines the distance the legend is moved inward from a corner of the data rectangle.

Custom Legend Encodings

Custom mark properties can be set for all legend elements using the encode parameter. The addressable elements are:


  legend for the legend group mark,
  title for the title text mark,
  labels for label text marks,
  symbols for legend symbol marks,
  entries for symbol legend group marks containing a symbol / label pair, and
  gradient for a gradient rect marks: one rect with gradient fill for continuous gradient legends, multiple rect marks with solid fill for discrete gradient legends.


Each element accepts a set of visual encoding directives grouped into enter, update, exit, etc. objects as described in the Marks documentation. Mark properties can be styled using standard value references.

In addition, each encode block may include a string-valued name property to assign a unique name to the mark set, a boolean-valued interactive property to enable input event handling, and a string-valued (or array-valued) style property to apply default property values. Unless otherwise specified, title elements use a default style of "guide-title" and labels elements use a default style of "guide-label".

Each legend symbol and label instance is backed by a data object with the following fields, which may be accessed as part of a custom visual encoding rule:


  index - an integer index
  label - the string label
  value - the data value
  size - the symbol size (for symbol legends only)


The following example shows how to set custom fonts and a border on a legend for a fill color encoding. The labels encoding block also make legend labels responsive to input events, and changes the text color on mouse hover.

  {
    "fill": "color",

Custom text can be defined using the text property for labels. For example, one could define an ordinal scale that serves as a lookup table from a backing value to legend label text. Note: to perform custom positioning when orient is none, use the top-level legendX and legendY properties, do not use x and y properties within a custom encoding block.\nLegends visualize scale mappings for visual values such as color, shape and size.

If multiple offset values are specified for a collection of legends with the same orient value, the maximum offset will be used.\nThe padding between the border and content of the legend group.\nBorder stroke color for the full legend.\nThe length in pixels of the primary axis of a color gradient. This value corresponds to the height of a vertical gradient or the width of a horizontal gradient.\nOpacity of the color gradient. ≥ 4.1\nThe thickness in pixels of the color gradient. This value corresponds to the width of a vertical gradient or the height of a horizontal gradient.\nStroke color of the color gradient border.\nStroke width of the color gradient border.\nHorizontal text alignment for legend labels.\nVertical text baseline for legend labels. One of alphabetic (default), top, middle, bottom, line-top, or line-bottom. The line-top and line-bottom values ≥ 5.10 operate similarly to top and bottom, but are calculated relative to the lineHeight rather than fontSize alone.\nText color for legend labels.\nFont name for legend labels.\nFont size in pixels for legend labels.\nFont style of legend labels (e.g., normal or italic). ≥ 5.0\nFont weight of legend labels.\nThe maximum allowed length in pixels of legend labels.\nOffset in pixels between legend labels their corresponding symbol or gradient.\nOpacity of legend labels. ≥ 4.1\nThe strategy to use for resolving overlap of labels in gradient legends. If false, no overlap reduction is attempted. If set to true (default) or "parity", a strategy of removing every other label is used. If set to "greedy", a linear scan of the labels is performed, removing any label that overlaps with the last visible label.\nThe minimum separation that must be between label bounding boxes for them to be considered non-overlapping (default 0). This property is ignored if labelOverlap resolution is not enabled. ≥ 5.0\nThe pixel x-coordinate of the legend group. Only applied if the orient value is "none". ≥ 5.4\nThe pixel y-coordinate of the legend group.

For scales of type time or utc, the tick count can instead be a time interval specifier. Legal string values are "millisecond", "second", "minute", "hour", "day", "week", "month", and "year". Alternatively, an object-valued interval specifier of the form {"interval": "month", "step": 3} includes a desired number of interval steps. Here, ticks are generated for each quarter (Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct) boundary.\nThe minimum desired step between tick values for quantitative legends, in terms of scale domain values. For example, a value of 1 indicates that ticks should not be less than 1 unit apart. If tickMinStep is specified, the tickCount value will be adjusted, if necessary, to enforce the minimum step value. ≥ 5.0\nThe title for the legend (none by default). For versions ≥ 5.7, a string array specifies a title with multiple lines of text.\nThe anchor position for placing the legend title. One of "start", "middle", "end", or null (default, for automatic determination). For example, with a titleOrient of "top" these anchor positions map to a left-, center-, or right-aligned title relative to the legend contents. ≥ 5.0\nHorizontal text alignment of the legend title. One of "left", "center", or "right". If specified, this value overrides automatic alignment based on the titleOrient and titleAnchor values.\nVertical text baseline of the legend title. One of alphabetic (default), top, middle, bottom, line-top, or line-bottom. The line-top and line-bottom values ≥ 5.10 operate similarly to top and bottom, but are calculated relative to the lineHeight rather than fontSize alone. If specified, this value overrides the automatic baseline based on the titleOrient and titleAnchor values.\nText color of the legend title.\nFont name of the legend title.\nFont size in pixels of the legend title.\nFont style of the legend title (e.g., normal or italic). ≥ 5.0\nFont weight of the legend title.\nThe maximum allowed length in pixels of the legend title.\nLine height in pixels for multi-line title text or title text with "line-top" or "line-bottom" baseline. ≥ 5.7\nOpacity of the legend title. ≥ 4.1\nThe orientation of the title legend, determining where it is placed relative to the legend contents. One of "top" (default), "left", "bottom", or "right". ≥ 5.0\nThe padding between the legend title and entries.\nExplicitly set the visible legend values. The array entries should be legal values in the backing scale domain.\nThe integer z-index indicating the layering of the legend group relative to other axis, mark, and legend groups. The default value is 0.\nAccessibility Properties ≥ 5.11\nAccessibility properties are used to determine ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes when using Vega to render SVG output.\nARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes\nA boolean flag (default true) indicating if ARIA attributes should be included (SVG output only). If false, the “aria-hidden” attribute will be set on the output SVG group, removing the legend from the ARIA accessibility tree.\nA text description of this legend for ARIA accessibility (SVG output only). If the aria property is true, for SVG output the “aria-label” attribute will be set to this description. If the description is unspecified it will be automatically generated.\n“aria-label” attribute\nThemes and Configuration\nTo create themes, new default values for legend properties can be set using a config object. The config object also supports customized layout behavior for collections of legends with the same orient value.\nLegend Orientation Reference\nValid settings for the legend orient parameter.\nPlace the legend to the left of the chart.\nPlace the legend to the right of the chart.\nPlace the legend above the top of the chart.\nPlace the legend below the bottom of the chart.\nPlace the legend inside the upper left corner of the chart.\nPlace the legend inside the upper right corner of the chart.\nPlace the legend inside the lower left corner of the chart.\nPlace the legend inside the lower right corner of the chart.\nDo not perform automatic layout. Allows custom layout by setting the legendX and legendY properties of the legend.\nMultiple legends: If multiple legends have a left or right orientation, they will be vertically ordered by default. If multiple legends have a top or bottom orientation, they will be horizontally ordered by default. In all other cases, legends will be drawn on top of each other when placed in the same location. The multiple legend layout can be customized by setting the legend layout config.\nLegend offset: In the case of left, right, top and bottom orientation, the offset parameter determines how far away the legend is placed from the rest of the chart. If the orientation is none, the offset parameter is ignored. For all other settings, the offset determines the distance the legend is moved inward from a corner of the data rectangle.\nCustom Legend Encodings\nCustom mark properties can be set for all legend elements using the encode parameter. The addressable elements are:\nlegend for the legend group mark,\ntitle for the title text mark,\nlabels for label text marks,\nsymbols for legend symbol marks,\nentries for symbol legend group marks containing a symbol / label pair, and\ngradient for a gradient rect marks: one rect with gradient fill for continuous gradient legends, multiple rect marks with solid fill for discrete gradient legends.\nEach element accepts a set of visual encoding directives grouped into enter, update, exit, etc. objects as described in the Marks documentation. Mark properties can be styled using standard value references.\nIn addition, each encode block may include a string-valued name property to assign a unique name to the mark set, a boolean-valued interactive property to enable input event handling, and a string-valued (or array-valued) style property to apply default property values. Unless otherwise specified, title elements use a default style of "guide-title" and labels elements use a default style of "guide-label".\nEach legend symbol and label instance is backed by a data object with the following fields, which may be accessed as part of a custom visual encoding rule:\nindex - an integer index\nlabel - the string label\nvalue - the data value\nsize - the symbol size (for symbol legends only)\nThe following example shows how to set custom fonts and a border on a legend for a fill color encoding. The labels encoding block also make legend labels responsive to input events, and changes the text color on mouse hover.\n"legends": [

      }
    }
  }
]\nCustom text can be defined using the text property for labels. For example, one could define an ordinal scale that serves as a lookup table from a backing value to legend label text. Note: to perform custom positioning when orient is none, use the top-level legendX and legendY properties, do not use x and y properties within a custom encoding block.\n\n\nVega

    Marks
    Graphical marks visually encode data using geometric primitives such as rectangles, lines, and plotting symbols. Marks are the basic visual building block of a visualization, providing basic shapes whose properties can be set according to backing data. Mark property definitions may be simple constants or data fields, or scales can be used to map data values to visual values.

Supported Mark Types

The supported mark types are:


  arc - Circular arcs, including pie and donut slices.
  area - Filled areas with horizontal or vertical alignment.
  image - Images, including icons or photographs.
  group - Containers for other marks, useful for sub-plots.
  line - Stroked lines, often used for showing change over time.
  path - Arbitrary paths or polygons, defined using SVG path syntax.
  rect - Rectangles, as in bar charts and timelines.
  rule - Rules are line segments, often used for axis ticks and grid lines.
  shape - A special variant of path marks for faster drawing of cartographic maps.
  symbol - Plotting symbols, including circles, squares and other shapes.
  text - Text labels with configurable fonts, alignment and angle.
  trail - Lines that can change size based on underlying data.


Visual Encoding

Each mark supports a set of visual encoding properties that determine the position and appearance of mark instances. Typically one mark instance is generated per input data element; the exceptions are the line and area mark types, which represent multiple data elements as a single line or area shape.

A mark definition typically looks something like this:

{
  "type": "rect",
  "from": {"data": "table"},
  "encode": {
    "enter": {
      "y": {"scale": "yscale", "field": "value"},
      "y2": {"scale": "yscale", "value": 0},
      "fill": {"value": "steelblue"}
    },
    "update": {...},
    "exit": {...},
    "hover": {...}
  }
}


There are three primary property sets: enter, update, exit. The enter properties are evaluated when data is processed for the first time and a mark instance is newly added to a scene. The update properties are evaluated for all existing (non-exiting) mark instances. The exit properties are evaluated when the data backing a mark is removed, and so the mark is leaving the visual scene. To better understand how enter, update, and exit sets work, take a look at Mike Bostock’s Thinking with Joins.

In addition, an optional hover set determines visual properties when the mouse cursor hovers over a mark instance. Upon mouse out, the update set is applied.

There is also a special group mark type (group) that can contain other marks, as well as local data, signal, scale, axis and legend definitions. Groups can be used to create visualizations consisting of grouped or repeated elements; examples include stacked graphs (each stack is a separate group containing a series of data values) and small multiples displays (each plot is contained in its own group). See the Group Marks page for more.

Top-Level Mark Properties


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      type
      String
      Required. The graphical mark type. Must be one of the supported mark types.
    
    
      clip
      Clip
      Indicates if the marks should be clipped to a specified shape (default false). If boolean-valued, the clipping region is the enclosing group’s width and height. If object-valued, should specify either an arbitrary SVG path string or a cartographic projection with which to clip to the sphere of the Earth.
    
    
      encode
      Encode
      An object containing a set of visual encoding rules for mark properties.
    
    
      from
      From
      An object describing the data this mark set should visualize. If undefined, a single element data set containing an empty object is assumed. The from property can either specify a data set to use (e.g., {"data": "table"}) or provide a faceting directive to subdivide a data set across a set of group marks.
    
    
      interactive
      Boolean
      A boolean flag (default true) indicating if the marks can serve as input event sources. If false, no mouse or touch events corresponding to the marks will be generated. This property can also take a Signal value to dynamically toggle interactive status.
    
    
      key
      Field
      A data field to use as a unique key for data binding. When a visualization’s data is updated, the key value will be used to match data elements to existing mark instances. Use a key field to enable object constancy for transitions over dynamic data.
    
    
      name
      String
      A unique name for the mark. This name can be used to refer to these marks within an event stream definition. SVG renderers will add this name value as a CSS class name on the enclosing SVG group (g) element containing the mark instances.
    
    
      on
      Trigger[ ]
      A set of triggers for modifying mark properties in response to signal changes.
    
    
      sort
      Compare
      A comparator for sorting mark items. The sort order will determine the default rendering order. The comparator is defined over generated scenegraph items and sorting is performed after encodings are computed, allowing items to be sorted by size or position. To sort by underlying data properties in addition to mark item properties, append the prefix datum. to a field name (e.g., {"field": "datum.field"}).
    
    
      transform
      Transform[ ]
      A set of post-encoding transforms, applied after any encode blocks, that operate directly on mark scenegraph items (not backing data objects). These can be useful for performing layout with transforms that can set x, y, width, height, etc. properties. Only data transforms that do not generate or filter data objects may be used.
    
    
      role
      String
      A metadata string indicating the role of the mark. SVG renderers will add this role value (prepended with the prefix role-) as a CSS class name on the enclosing SVG group (g) element containing the mark instances. Roles are used internally by Vega to guide layout. Do not set this property unless you know which layout effect you are trying to achieve.
    
    
      style
      String | String[ ]
      A string or array of strings indicating the name of custom styles to apply to the mark. A style is a named collection of mark property defaults defined within the configuration. These properties will be applied to the mark’s enter encoding set, with later styles overriding earlier styles. Any properties explicitly defined within the mark’s encode block will override a style default.
    
    
      zindex
      Number
      The integer z-index indicating the layering of this mark set relative to other marks, axes, or legends. The default value is 0; higher values (1) will cause this mark set to be drawn on top of other mark, axis, or legend definitions with lower z-index values. Note that this value applies to the all marks in a set, not individual mark items. To adjust the ordering of items within a set, use the zindex encoding channel.
    
  


Accessibility Properties ≥ 5.11

Accessibility properties are used to determine ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes when using Vega to render SVG output. Vega will automatically generate ARIA “role” and “roleDescription” attributes for container SVG <g> elements for a set of mark items. The properties below can be used to disable ARIA attributes or add additional description text. In addition, individual mark items can have per-item ARIA attributes, defined within encoding channels.


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      aria
      Boolean
      A boolean flag (default true) indicating if ARIA attributes should be included (SVG output only). If false, the “aria-hidden” attribute will be set on the output SVG group for the marks, removing the mark from the ARIA accessibility tree.
    
    
      description
      String
      A text description of this mark for ARIA accessibility (SVG output only). If the aria property is true, for SVG output the “aria-label” attribute will be set to this description.
    
  


Mark Clipping

The clip property limits the area in which a set of marks is visible. The default value (boolean false) disables clipping. A boolean true value clips the marks to the width and height of the enclosing group mark. The clip property also accepts a signal that evaluates to a boolean value.

An object specification can be used to define more sophisticated clipping regions. An object-valued clip must have either a path property (for arbitrary SVG paths) or a sphere property (to clip to the globe, relative to a geographic projection), but not both. Either property can be a signal value to enable dynamic clipping regions.


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      path
      String | Signal
      An SVG path string describing the clipping region. The path is assumed to lie relative to the coordinate system of the enclosing group.
    
    
      sphere
      String | Signal
      The name of a cartographic projection with which to clip all marks to the projected sphere of the globe. This option is useful in conjunction with map projections that otherwise included projected content (such as graticule lines) outside the bounds of the globe.
    
  


Mark Data Sources (from)

The from property indicates the data source for a set of marks.


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      data
      String
      The name of the data set to draw from.
    
    
      facet
      Facet
      An optional facet definition for partitioning data across multiple group marks. Only group mark definitions may use the facet directive.
    
  


Faceting

The facet directive splits up a data source among multiple group mark items. Each group mark is backed by an aggregate data value representing the entire group, and then instantiated with its own named data source that contains a local partition of the data. Facets can either be data-driven, in which partitions are determined by grouping data values according to specified attributes, or pre-faceted, such that a source data value already contains within it an array of sub-values.


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      name
      String
      Required. The name of the generated facet data source. Marks defined with the faceted group mark can reference this data source to visualize the local data partition.
    
    
      data
      String
      Required. The name of the source data set from which the facet partitions are generated.
    
    
      field
      Field
      For pre-faceted data, the name of the data field containing an array of data values to use as the local partition. This property is required if using pre-faceted data.
    
    
      groupby
      Field | Field[ ]
      For data-driven facets, an array of field names by which to partition the data. This property is required if using data-driven facets.
    
    
      aggregate
      Object
      For data-driven facets, an optional object containing aggregate transform parameters for the aggregate data values generated for each facet group item. The supported parameters are fields, ops, as, and cross.
    
  


When generating data-driven facets, by default new aggregate data values are generated to serve as the data backing each group mark item. However, if both the data and facet properties are defined in the from object, pre-existing aggregate values will be pulled from the named data source. In such cases it is critical that the aggregate and facet groupby domains match. If they do not match, the behavior of the resulting visualization is undefined.

Reactive Geometry

Typically a "from": {"data": "..."} statement draws data from a backing data source defined within a "data" block. However, Vega can also use a set of marks as the backing data objects for a new set of marks — a feature referred to as reactive geometry. For example, one might add text marks to serve as labels, using computed x, y, width, or height values of the source marks to determine label placement.

To use a set of marks as a backing data source, the mark definition must include a unique name property. The marks can then be referenced as "from": {"data": "name"}.

Here is an example in which point marks serve as the backing data for a set of text marks:

{
  "marks": [
    {
      "name": "baseMarks",
      "type": "point",
      "from": {"data": "source"},
      "encode": {...}
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "from": {"data": "baseMarks"},
      "encode": {
        "update": {
          "x": {"field": "x", "offset": 4},
          "y": {"field": "y"},
          "text": {"field": "datum.label"}
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}


Mark Encoding Sets

All visual mark property definitions are specified as name-value pairs in a property set (such as update, enter, or exit). The name is simply the name of the visual property: individual mark types support standardized encoding channel names, but arbitrary names are also allowed, resulting in new named properties on output scenegraph items. The value of a property definition should be a value reference or production rule, as defined below.

The enter set is invoked when a mark item is first instantiated. Unless otherwise indicated, the update set is invoked whenever data or display properties update. The exit set is invoked when the data value backing a mark item is removed. If hover processing is requested on the Vega View instance, the hover set will be invoked upon mouse hover.

Custom encoding sets with arbitrary names are also allowed. To invoke a custom encoding set (e.g., instead of the update set), either pass the encoding set name to the Vega View run method or define a signal event handler with an "encode" directive.

Value References

A value reference specifies the value for a given mark property. The value may be a constant or drawn from a data object. In addition, the value may be run through a scale transform and further modified. Examples include:


  {"value": "left"} - Literal value
  {"field": "amount"} - Data field value
  {"scale": "yscale", "field": "amount"} - Scale-transformed data field value
  {"signal": "hypot(datum.a, datum.b)" - Signal expression value


For more, see the Value type documentation, including the specialized Color Value and Field Value types.

Production Rules

Visual properties can also be set by evaluating an “if-then-else” style chain of production rules. Rules consist of an array of value reference objects, each of which must contain an additional test property. The value of this property should be a predicate expression, that evaluates to true or false. The visual property is set to the value reference corresponding to the first predicate that evaluates to true within the rule.

A single value reference, without a test property, can be specified as the final element within the rule to serve as the “else” condition.
If no test properties evaluate to true, the property is set to this final (predicate-less) value reference. If no “else” condition is specified, the property value defaults to null.

For example, the following specification sets a mark’s fill colour using a production rule:

"fill": [
  {
    "test": "indata('selectedPoints', 'key', datum.key)",
    "scale": "c",
    "field": "species"
  },
  {"value": "grey"}
]


Here, if the ID of a particular data point is found in the selectedPoints data source, the fill color is determined by a scale transform. Otherwise, the mark instance is filled grey.\nVega

    Marks
    Graphical marks visually encode data using geometric primitives such as rectangles, lines, and plotting symbols. Marks are the basic visual building block of a visualization, providing basic shapes whose properties can be set according to backing data. Mark property definitions may be simple constants or data fields, or scales can be used to map data values to visual values.

Supported Mark Types

The supported mark types are:


  arc - Circular arcs, including pie and donut slices.
  area - Filled areas with horizontal or vertical alignment.
  image - Images, including icons or photographs.
  group - Containers for other marks, useful for sub-plots.
  line - Stroked lines, often used for showing change over time.
  path - Arbitrary paths or polygons, defined using SVG path syntax.
  rect - Rectangles, as in bar charts and timelines.
  rule - Rules are line segments, often used for axis ticks and grid lines.
  shape - A special variant of path marks for faster drawing of cartographic maps.
  symbol - Plotting symbols, including circles, squares and other shapes.
  text - Text labels with configurable fonts, alignment and angle.
  trail - Lines that can change size based on underlying data.


Visual Encoding

Each mark supports a set of visual encoding properties that determine the position and appearance of mark instances. Typically one mark instance is generated per input data element; the exceptions are the line and area mark types, which represent multiple data elements as a single line or area shape.

A mark definition typically looks something like this:

{
  "type": "rect",
  "from": {"data": "table"},
  "encode": {
    "enter": {
      "y": {"scale": "yscale", "field": "value"},
      "y2": {"scale": "yscale", "value": 0},
      "fill": {"value": "steelblue"}
    },
    "update": {...},
    "exit": {...},
    "hover": {...}
  }
}


There are three primary property sets: enter, update, exit. The enter properties are evaluated when data is processed for the first time and a mark instance is newly added to a scene. The update properties are evaluated for all existing (non-exiting) mark instances. The exit properties are evaluated when the data backing a mark is removed, and so the mark is leaving the visual scene. To better understand how enter, update, and exit sets work, take a look at Mike Bostock’s Thinking with Joins.

In addition, an optional hover set determines visual properties when the mouse cursor hovers over a mark instance. Upon mouse out, the update set is applied.

There is also a special group mark type (group) that can contain other marks, as well as local data, signal, scale, axis and legend definitions. Groups can be used to create visualizations consisting of grouped or repeated elements; examples include stacked graphs (each stack is a separate group containing a series of data values) and small multiples displays (each plot is contained in its own group). See the Group Marks page for more.

Top-Level Mark Properties


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      type
      String
      Required. The graphical mark type. Must be one of the supported mark types.
    
    
      clip
      Clip
      Indicates if the marks should be clipped to a specified shape (default false). If boolean-valued, the clipping region is the enclosing group’s width and height. If object-valued, should specify either an arbitrary SVG path string or a cartographic projection with which to clip to the sphere of the Earth.
    
    
      encode
      Encode
      An object containing a set of visual encoding rules for mark properties.
    
    
      from
      From
      An object describing the data this mark set should visualize. If undefined, a single element data set containing an empty object is assumed. The from property can either specify a data set to use (e.g., {"data": "table"}) or provide a faceting directive to subdivide a data set across a set of group marks.
    
    
      interactive
      Boolean
      A boolean flag (default true) indicating if the marks can serve as input event sources. If false, no mouse or touch events corresponding to the marks will be generated. This property can also take a Signal value to dynamically toggle interactive status.
    
    
      key
      Field
      A data field to use as a unique key for data binding. When a visualization’s data is updated, the key value will be used to match data elements to existing mark instances. Use a key field to enable object constancy for transitions over dynamic data.
    
    
      name
      String
      A unique name for the mark. This name can be used to refer to these marks within an event stream definition. SVG renderers will add this name value as a CSS class name on the enclosing SVG group (g) element containing the mark instances.
    
    
      on
      Trigger[ ]
      A set of triggers for modifying mark properties in response to signal changes.
    
    
      sort
      Compare
      A comparator for sorting mark items. The sort order will determine the default rendering order. The comparator is defined over generated scenegraph items and sorting is performed after encodings are computed, allowing items to be sorted by size or position. To sort by underlying data properties in addition to mark item properties, append the prefix datum. to a field name (e.g., {"field": "datum.field"}).
    
    
      transform
      Transform[ ]
      A set of post-encoding transforms, applied after any encode blocks, that operate directly on mark scenegraph items (not backing data objects). These can be useful for performing layout with transforms that can set x, y, width, height, etc. properties. Only data transforms that do not generate or filter data objects may be used.
    
    
      role
      String
      A metadata string indicating the role of the mark. SVG renderers will add this role value (prepended with the prefix role-) as a CSS class name on the enclosing SVG group (g) element containing the mark instances. Roles are used internally by Vega to guide layout. Do not set this property unless you know which layout effect you are trying to achieve.
    
    
      style
      String | String[ ]
      A string or array of strings indicating the name of custom styles to apply to the mark. A style is a named collection of mark property defaults defined within the configuration. These properties will be applied to the mark’s enter encoding set, with later styles overriding earlier styles. Any properties explicitly defined within the mark’s encode block will override a style default.
    
    
      zindex
      Number
      The integer z-index indicating the layering of this mark set relative to other marks, axes, or legends. The default value is 0; higher values (1) will cause this mark set to be drawn on top of other mark, axis, or legend definitions with lower z-index values. Note that this value applies to the all marks in a set, not individual mark items. To adjust the ordering of items within a set, use the zindex encoding channel.
    
  


Accessibility Properties ≥ 5.11

Accessibility properties are used to determine ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes when using Vega to render SVG output. Vega will automatically generate ARIA “role” and “roleDescription” attributes for container SVG <g> elements for a set of mark items. The properties below can be used to disable ARIA attributes or add additional description text. In addition, individual mark items can have per-item ARIA attributes, defined within encoding channels.


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      aria
      Boolean
      A boolean flag (default true) indicating if ARIA attributes should be included (SVG output only). If false, the “aria-hidden” attribute will be set on the output SVG group for the marks, removing the mark from the ARIA accessibility tree.
    
    
      description
      String
      A text description of this mark for ARIA accessibility (SVG output only). If the aria property is true, for SVG output the “aria-label” attribute will be set to this description.
    
  


Mark Clipping

The clip property limits the area in which a set of marks is visible. The default value (boolean false) disables clipping. A boolean true value clips the marks to the width and height of the enclosing group mark. The clip property also accepts a signal that evaluates to a boolean value.

An object specification can be used to define more sophisticated clipping regions. An object-valued clip must have either a path property (for arbitrary SVG paths) or a sphere property (to clip to the globe, relative to a geographic projection), but not both. Either property can be a signal value to enable dynamic clipping regions.


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      path
      String | Signal
      An SVG path string describing the clipping region. The path is assumed to lie relative to the coordinate system of the enclosing group.
    
    
      sphere
      String | Signal
      The name of a cartographic projection with which to clip all marks to the projected sphere of the globe. This option is useful in conjunction with map projections that otherwise included projected content (such as graticule lines) outside the bounds of the globe.
    
  


Mark Data Sources (from)

The from property indicates the data source for a set of marks.


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      data
      String
      The name of the data set to draw from.
    
    
      facet
      Facet
      An optional facet definition for partitioning data across multiple group marks. Only group mark definitions may use the facet directive.
    
  


Faceting

The facet directive splits up a data source among multiple group mark items. Each group mark is backed by an aggregate data value representing the entire group, and then instantiated with its own named data source that contains a local partition of the data. Facets can either be data-driven, in which partitions are determined by grouping data values according to specified attributes, or pre-faceted, such that a source data value already contains within it an array of sub-values.


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      name
      String
      Required. The name of the generated facet data source. Marks defined with the faceted group mark can reference this data source to visualize the local data partition.
    
    
      data
      String
      Required. The name of the source data set from which the facet partitions are generated.
    
    
      field
      Field
      For pre-faceted data, the name of the data field containing an array of data values to use as the local partition. This property is required if using pre-faceted data.
    
    
      groupby
      Field | Field[ ]
      For data-driven facets, an array of field names by which to partition the data. This property is required if using data-driven facets.
    
    
      aggregate
      Object
      For data-driven facets, an optional object containing aggregate transform parameters for the aggregate data values generated for each facet group item. The supported parameters are fields, ops, as, and cross.
    
  


When generating data-driven facets, by default new aggregate data values are generated to serve as the data backing each group mark item. However, if both the data and facet properties are defined in the from object, pre-existing aggregate values will be pulled from the named data source. In such cases it is critical that the aggregate and facet groupby domains match. If they do not match, the behavior of the resulting visualization is undefined.

Reactive Geometry

Typically a "from": {"data": "..."} statement draws data from a backing data source defined within a "data" block. However, Vega can also use a set of marks as the backing data objects for a new set of marks — a feature referred to as reactive geometry. For example, one might add text marks to serve as labels, using computed x, y, width, or height values of the source marks to determine label placement.

To use a set of marks as a backing data source, the mark definition must include a unique name property. The marks can then be referenced as "from": {"data": "name"}.

Here is an example in which point marks serve as the backing data for a set of text marks:

{
  "marks": [
    {
      "name": "baseMarks",
      "type": "point",
      "from": {"data": "source"},
      "encode": {...}
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "from": {"data": "baseMarks"},
      "encode": {
        "update": {
          "x": {"field": "x", "offset": 4},
          "y": {"field": "y"},
          "text": {"field": "datum.label"}
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}


Mark Encoding Sets

All visual mark property definitions are specified as name-value pairs in a property set (such as update, enter, or exit). The name is simply the name of the visual property: individual mark types support standardized encoding channel names, but arbitrary names are also allowed, resulting in new named properties on output scenegraph items. The value of a property definition should be a value reference or production rule, as defined below.

The enter set is invoked when a mark item is first instantiated. Unless otherwise indicated, the update set is invoked whenever data or display properties update. The exit set is invoked when the data value backing a mark item is removed. If hover processing is requested on the Vega View instance, the hover set will be invoked upon mouse hover.

Custom encoding sets with arbitrary names are also allowed. To invoke a custom encoding set (e.g., instead of the update set), either pass the encoding set name to the Vega View run method or define a signal event handler with an "encode" directive.

Value References

A value reference specifies the value for a given mark property. The value may be a constant or drawn from a data object. In addition, the value may be run through a scale transform and further modified. Examples include:


  {"value": "left"} - Literal value
  {"field": "amount"} - Data field value
  {"scale": "yscale", "field": "amount"} - Scale-transformed data field value
  {"signal": "hypot(datum.a, datum.b)" - Signal expression value


For more, see the Value type documentation, including the specialized Color Value and Field Value types.

Production Rules

Visual properties can also be set by evaluating an “if-then-else” style chain of production rules. Rules consist of an array of value reference objects, each of which must contain an additional test property. The value of this property should be a predicate expression, that evaluates to true or false. The visual property is set to the value reference corresponding to the first predicate that evaluates to true within the rule.

A single value reference, without a test property, can be specified as the final element within the rule to serve as the “else” condition.
If no test properties evaluate to true, the property is set to this final (predicate-less) value reference. If no “else” condition is specified, the property value defaults to null.

For example, the following specification sets a mark’s fill colour using a production rule:

"fill": [
  {
    "test": "indata('selectedPoints', 'key', datum.key)",
    "scale": "c",
    "field": "species"
  },
  {"value": "grey"}
]


Here, if the ID of a particular data point is found in the selectedPoints data source, the fill color is determined by a scale transform. Otherwise, the mark instance is filled grey.\nGraphical marks visually encode data using geometric primitives such as rectangles, lines, and plotting symbols.

Any properties explicitly defined within the mark’s encode block will override a style default.\nThe integer z-index indicating the layering of this mark set relative to other marks, axes, or legends. The default value is 0; higher values (1) will cause this mark set to be drawn on top of other mark, axis, or legend definitions with lower z-index values. Note that this value applies to the all marks in a set, not individual mark items. To adjust the ordering of items within a set, use the zindex encoding channel.\nAccessibility Properties ≥ 5.11\nAccessibility properties are used to determine ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes when using Vega to render SVG output. Vega will automatically generate ARIA “role” and “roleDescription” attributes for container SVG <g> elements for a set of mark items. The properties below can be used to disable ARIA attributes or add additional description text. In addition, individual mark items can have per-item ARIA attributes, defined within encoding channels.\nARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes\nA boolean flag (default true) indicating if ARIA attributes should be included (SVG output only). If false, the “aria-hidden” attribute will be set on the output SVG group for the marks, removing the mark from the ARIA accessibility tree.\nA text description of this mark for ARIA accessibility (SVG output only). If the aria property is true, for SVG output the “aria-label” attribute will be set to this description.\n“aria-label” attribute\nThe clip property limits the area in which a set of marks is visible. The default value (boolean false) disables clipping. A boolean true value clips the marks to the width and height of the enclosing group mark. The clip property also accepts a signal that evaluates to a boolean value.\nAn object specification can be used to define more sophisticated clipping regions. An object-valued clip must have either a path property (for arbitrary SVG paths) or a sphere property (to clip to the globe, relative to a geographic projection), but not both. Either property can be a signal value to enable dynamic clipping regions.\nAn SVG path string describing the clipping region. The path is assumed to lie relative to the coordinate system of the enclosing group.\nThe name of a cartographic projection with which to clip all marks to the projected sphere of the globe. This option is useful in conjunction with map projections that otherwise included projected content (such as graticule lines) outside the bounds of the globe.\nMark Data Sources (from)\nThe from property indicates the data source for a set of marks.\nThe name of the data set to draw from.\nAn optional facet definition for partitioning data across multiple group marks. Only group mark definitions may use the facet directive.\nThe facet directive splits up a data source among multiple group mark items. Each group mark is backed by an aggregate data value representing the entire group, and then instantiated with its own named data source that contains a local partition of the data. Facets can either be data-driven, in which partitions are determined by grouping data values according to specified attributes, or pre-faceted, such that a source data value already contains within it an array of sub-values.\nRequired. The name of the generated facet data source. Marks defined with the faceted group mark can reference this data source to visualize the local data partition.\nRequired. The name of the source data set from which the facet partitions are generated.\nFor pre-faceted data, the name of the data field containing an array of data values to use as the local partition. This property is required if using pre-faceted data.\nFor data-driven facets, an array of field names by which to partition the data. This property is required if using data-driven facets.\nFor data-driven facets, an optional object containing aggregate transform parameters for the aggregate data values generated for each facet group item. The supported parameters are fields, ops, as, and cross.\naggregate transform parameters\nWhen generating data-driven facets, by default new aggregate data values are generated to serve as the data backing each group mark item. However, if both the data and facet properties are defined in the from object, pre-existing aggregate values will be pulled from the named data source. In such cases it is critical that the aggregate and facet groupby domains match. If they do not match, the behavior of the resulting visualization is undefined.\nTypically a "from": {"data": "..."} statement draws data from a backing data source defined within a "data" block. However, Vega can also use a set of marks as the backing data objects for a new set of marks — a feature referred to as reactive geometry. For example, one might add text marks to serve as labels, using computed x, y, width, or height values of the source marks to determine label placement.\nTo use a set of marks as a backing data source, the mark definition must include a unique name property. The marks can then be referenced as "from": {"data": "name"}.\nHere is an example in which point marks serve as the backing data for a set of text marks:\n{
  "marks": [
    {
      "name": "baseMarks",
      "type": "point",
      "from": {"data": "source"},
      "encode": {...}
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "from": {"data": "baseMarks"},
      "encode": {
        "update": {
          "x": {"field": "x", "offset": 4},
          "y": {"field": "y"},
          "text": {"field": "datum.label"}
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}\n{
  "marks": [
    {
      "name": "baseMarks",
      "type": "point",
      "from": {"data": "source"},
      "encode": {...}
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "from": {"data": "baseMarks"},
      "encode": {
        "update": {
          "x": {"field": "x", "offset": 4},
          "y": {"field": "y"},
          "text": {"field": "datum.label"}
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}\nAll visual mark property definitions are specified as name-value pairs in a property set (such as update, enter, or exit). The name is simply the name of the visual property: individual mark types support standardized encoding channel names, but arbitrary names are also allowed, resulting in new named properties on output scenegraph items. The value of a property definition should be a value reference or production rule, as defined below.\nThe enter set is invoked when a mark item is first instantiated. Unless otherwise indicated, the update set is invoked whenever data or display properties update. The exit set is invoked when the data value backing a mark item is removed. If hover processing is requested on the Vega View instance, the hover set will be invoked upon mouse hover.\nCustom encoding sets with arbitrary names are also allowed. To invoke a custom encoding set (e.g., instead of the update set), either pass the encoding set name to the Vega View run method or define a signal event handler with an "encode" directive.\nsignal event handler with an "encode" directive\nA value reference specifies the value for a given mark property. The value may be a constant or drawn from a data object. In addition, the value may be run through a scale transform and further modified. Examples include:\n{"value": "left"} - Literal value\n{"field": "amount"} - Data field value\n{"scale": "yscale", "field": "amount"} - Scale-transformed data field value\n{"signal": "hypot(datum.a, datum.b)" - Signal expression value\nFor more, see the Value type documentation, including the specialized Color Value and Field Value types.\nValue type documentation\nVisual properties can also be set by evaluating an “if-then-else” style chain of production rules. Rules consist of an array of value reference objects, each of which must contain an additional test property. The value of this property should be a predicate expression, that evaluates to true or false. The visual property is set to the value reference corresponding to the first predicate that evaluates to true within the rule.\nA single value reference, without a test property, can be specified as the final element within the rule to serve as the “else” condition.
If no test properties evaluate to true, the property is set to this final (predicate-less) value reference. If no “else” condition is specified, the property value defaults to null.\nFor example, the following specification sets a mark’s fill colour using a production rule:\n"fill": [
  {
    "test": "indata('selectedPoints', 'key', datum.key)",
    "scale": "c",
    "field": "species"
  },
  {"value": "grey"}
]\n"fill": [
  {
    "test": "indata('selectedPoints', 'key', datum.key)",
    "scale": "c",
    "field": "species"
  },
  {"value": "grey"}
]\n"indata('selectedPoints', 'key', datum.key)"\nHere, if the ID of a particular data point is found in the selectedPoints data source, the fill color is determined by a scale transform. Otherwise, the mark instance is filled grey.\n\n\nVega

    Signals
    Signals are dynamic variables that parameterize a visualization and can drive interactive behaviors. Signals can be used throughout a Vega specification, for example to define a mark property or data transform parameter.

Signal values are reactive: they can update in response to input event streams, external API calls, or changes to upstream signals. Event streams capture and sequence input events, such as mousedown or touchmove. When an event occurs, signals with associated event handlers are re-evaluated in their specification order. Updated signal values then propagate to the rest of the specification, and the visualization is re-rendered automatically.

A signal definition, and its use in the rest of a specification, looks something like this:

{
  "signals": [
    {
      "name": "indexDate",
      "description": "A date value that updates in response to mousemove.",
      "update": "datetime(2005, 0, 1)",
      "on": [{"events": "mousemove", "update": "invert('xscale', x())"}]
    }
  ],
  "data": [
    { "name": "stocks", ... },
    {
      "name": "index",
      "source": "stocks",
      "transform": [
        {
          "type": "filter",
          "expr": "month(datum.date) === month(indexDate)"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "scales": [
    { "name": "x", "type": "time", ... }
  ],
  "marks": [
    {
      "type": "rule",
      "encode": {
        "update": {
          "x": {"scale": "x", "signal": "indexDate"}
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}


Signal Properties

Signal definitions may use the following properties.


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      name
      String
      Required. A unique name for the signal. Signal names should be valid JavaScript identifiers: they should contain only alphanumeric characters (or “$”, or “_”) and may not start with a digit. Reserved keywords that may not be used as signal names are "datum", "event", "item", and "parent".
    
    
      bind
      Bind
      Binds the signal to an external input element such as a slider, selection list or radio button group.
    
    
      description
      String
      A text description of the signal, useful for inline documentation.
    
    
      on
      Handler[ ]
      An array of event stream handlers for updating the signal value in response to input events.
    
    
      init
      Expression
      ≥ 4.4 An initialization expression for the value of the signal. This expression will be invoked once and only once. The init and update parameters are mutually exclusive and can not be used together.
    
    
      update
      Expression
      An update expression for the value of the signal. This expression may include other signals, in which case the signal will automatically update in response to upstream signal changes, so long as the react property is not false. The init and update parameters are mutually exclusive and can not be used together.
    
    
      react
      Boolean
      A boolean flag (default true) indicating if the update expression should be automatically re-evaluated when any upstream signal dependencies update. If false, the update expression will not register any dependencies on other signals, even for initialization.
    
    
      value
      Any
      The initial value of the signal (default undefined). This value is assigned prior to evaluating either the init or update expression.
    
  


Built-in signals

A few signal names are automatically processed and/or reserved:


  Signals for the specification width, height, padding, autosize, and (for version ≥ 5.10) background properties are automatically defined. Specifications may include definitions for these signals in the top-level signals array, in which case the definitions will be merged with any top-level specification property values, with precedence given to properties defined in the signals array.
  Group mark instances automatically include a parent signal bound to the data object for that group. Specifications may not define a signal named parent.
  The signal names datum, item, and event are reserved for top-level variables within expressions. Specifications may not define signals named datum, item or event.
  If you define a signal named cursor, its value will automatically drive the CSS mouse cursor for the Vega view. For more, see the cursor signal documentation below.


The cursor Signal

By default, Vega will style the mouse pointer when it is over a mark with a defined cursor property. However, in some interactive use cases, the cursor style should persist for the entire duration of an interaction (e.g., while dragging, regardless if the cursor remains over the item where the drag initiated). For more control, Vega provides a dedicated cursor signal. When the value of this signal is set, Vega uses it in lieu of any cursor properties set on marks. If the value is set to "default", Vega resumes using the mark-based cursor property.

Nested Signals

Signals can be defined either in the top-level scope of a specification or within a group mark definition. If a signal is defined within a nested group, it is accessible only within the scope of that group; any marks, axes, legends, etc. that reference the signal must be contained within the group. If a nested signal has the same name as a signal defined in an outer scope, the new signal will override the previously defined signal.

In addition to new signal definitions, nested group marks may contain signal updates that target a signal defined in an outer scope. The "push": "outer" property indicates that, rather than create a new signal, updates should explicitly target an existing signal. Nested signal updates may not include value or update properties. The supported properties for signal updates are:


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      name
      String
      Required. The name of the signal to update.
    
    
      push
      String
      Required. To indicate an update to a signal defined in an outer scope, the push property must be set to "outer".
    
    
      description
      String
      A text description of the signal, useful for documentation.
    
    
      on
      Handler[ ]
      An array of event stream handlers for updating the signal value in response to input events.
    
  


Event Handlers

An event handler object includes an event stream definition indicating which events to respond to, and either an update expression for setting a new signal value, or an encode set for updating the mark being interacted with.


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      events
      EventStream
      Required. The events to respond to.
    
    
      update
      Expression
      An expression that is evaluated when events occur, the result then becomes the new signal value. This property is required if encode is not specified.
    
    
      encode
      String
      The name of a mark property encoding set to re-evaluate for the mark item that was the source of the input event. This property is required if update is not specified.
    
    
      force
      Boolean
      A boolean flag (default false) indicating whether or not updates that do not change the signal value should propagate. For example, if set to true and an input stream update sets the signal to its current value, downstream signals will still be notified of an update.
    
  


This signal definition increments its value upon mouseover of rect items:

{
  "name": "count",
  "value": 0,
  "on": [
    {"events": "rect:mouseover", "update": "count + 1"}
  ]
}


This signal definition invokes a custom encoding set upon mousedown and mouseup on mark items. The mark definition must include properties named "select" and "release" under the mark "encode" property.

{
  "name": "clickEncode",
  "on": [
    {"events": "*:mousedown", "encode": "select"},
    {"events": "*:mouseup", "encode": "release"}
  ]
}


Input Element Binding

The bind property binds a signal to an input element defined outside of the visualization. Vega will generate new HTML form elements and set up a two-way binding: changes to the input element will update the signal, and vice versa. Vega includes dedicated support for checkbox (single boolean value), radio (group of radio buttons), select (drop-down menu), and range (slider) input types. Alternatively, Vega can also bind directly to externally-defined input elements.


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      input
      String
      Required. The type of input element to use. The valid values are checkbox, radio, range, select, and any other legal HTML form input type.
    
    
      element
      String
      An optional CSS selector string indicating the parent element to which the input element should be added. By default, all input elements are added within the parent container of the Vega view.
    
    
      name
      String
      By default, the signal name is used to label input elements. This name property can be used to specify a custom label instead for the bound signal.
    
    
      debounce
      Number
      If defined, delays event handling until the specified milliseconds have elapsed since the last event was fired.
    
  


Radio and Select Input Properties


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      options
      Array
      Required. An array of options to select from.
    
    
      labels
      String[ ]
      ≥ 5.9 An array of label strings to represent the options values. If unspecified, the options value will be coerced to a string and used as the label.
    
    
      name
      String
      By default, the signal name is used to label input elements. This name property can be used to specify a custom label instead for the bound signal.
    
    
      debounce
      Number
      If defined, delays event handling until the specified milliseconds have elapsed since the last event was fired.
    
  


Range Input Properties


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      max
      Number
      For range inputs, sets the maximum slider value. Defaults to the larger of the signal value and 100.
    
    
      min
      Number
      For range inputs, sets the minimum slider value. Defaults to the smaller of the signal value and 0.
    
    
      step
      Number
      For range inputs, sets the minimum slider increment. If undefined, the step size will be automatically determined based on the min and max values.
    
    
      name
      String
      By default, the signal name is used to label input elements. This name property can be used to specify a custom label instead for the bound signal.
    
    
      debounce
      Number
      If defined, delays event handling until the specified milliseconds have elapsed since the last event was fired.
    
  


Other Input Types

In addition, any valid HTML input type may be used as the value of the input property. Examples include "text" (for single-line text entry), "color" (for a color picker), and "date" (for entering year, month and day).
In these cases, any extra properties defined (e.g., placeholder for "text" input) will be added as attributes of the generated HTML form element.

Binding Directly to External Elements

Rather than generate its own input elements, Vega also supports binding directly to an existing element defined externally. To do so, the input property must be undefined, and the element property must reference an existing, externally defined element.


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      element
      String
      Required. An input element that exposes a value property and supports the EventTarget interface, or a CSS selector string to such an element. When the element updates and dispatches an event, the value property will be used as the new, bound signal value. When the signal updates independent of the element, the value property will be set to the signal value and a new event will be dispatched on the element.
    
    
      event
      String
      The event (default "input") to listen for to track changes on the external element.
    
    
      debounce
      Number
      If defined, delays event handling until the specified milliseconds have elapsed since the last event was fired.\nVega

    Signals
    Signals are dynamic variables that parameterize a visualization and can drive interactive behaviors. Signals can be used throughout a Vega specification, for example to define a mark property or data transform parameter.

Signal values are reactive: they can update in response to input event streams, external API calls, or changes to upstream signals. Event streams capture and sequence input events, such as mousedown or touchmove. When an event occurs, signals with associated event handlers are re-evaluated in their specification order. Updated signal values then propagate to the rest of the specification, and the visualization is re-rendered automatically.

A signal definition, and its use in the rest of a specification, looks something like this:

{
  "signals": [
    {
      "name": "indexDate",
      "description": "A date value that updates in response to mousemove.",
      "update": "datetime(2005, 0, 1)",
      "on": [{"events": "mousemove", "update": "invert('xscale', x())"}]
    }
  ],
  "data": [
    { "name": "stocks", ... },
    {
      "name": "index",
      "source": "stocks",
      "transform": [
        {
          "type": "filter",
          "expr": "month(datum.date) === month(indexDate)"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "scales": [
    { "name": "x", "type": "time", ... }
  ],
  "marks": [
    {
      "type": "rule",
      "encode": {
        "update": {
          "x": {"scale": "x", "signal": "indexDate"}
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}


Signal Properties

Signal definitions may use the following properties.


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      name
      String
      Required. A unique name for the signal. Signal names should be valid JavaScript identifiers: they should contain only alphanumeric characters (or “$”, or “_”) and may not start with a digit. Reserved keywords that may not be used as signal names are "datum", "event", "item", and "parent".
    
    
      bind
      Bind
      Binds the signal to an external input element such as a slider, selection list or radio button group.
    
    
      description
      String
      A text description of the signal, useful for inline documentation.
    
    
      on
      Handler[ ]
      An array of event stream handlers for updating the signal value in response to input events.
    
    
      init
      Expression
      ≥ 4.4 An initialization expression for the value of the signal. This expression will be invoked once and only once. The init and update parameters are mutually exclusive and can not be used together.
    
    
      update
      Expression
      An update expression for the value of the signal. This expression may include other signals, in which case the signal will automatically update in response to upstream signal changes, so long as the react property is not false. The init and update parameters are mutually exclusive and can not be used together.
    
    
      react
      Boolean
      A boolean flag (default true) indicating if the update expression should be automatically re-evaluated when any upstream signal dependencies update. If false, the update expression will not register any dependencies on other signals, even for initialization.
    
    
      value
      Any
      The initial value of the signal (default undefined). This value is assigned prior to evaluating either the init or update expression.
    
  


Built-in signals

A few signal names are automatically processed and/or reserved:


  Signals for the specification width, height, padding, autosize, and (for version ≥ 5.10) background properties are automatically defined. Specifications may include definitions for these signals in the top-level signals array, in which case the definitions will be merged with any top-level specification property values, with precedence given to properties defined in the signals array.
  Group mark instances automatically include a parent signal bound to the data object for that group. Specifications may not define a signal named parent.
  The signal names datum, item, and event are reserved for top-level variables within expressions. Specifications may not define signals named datum, item or event.
  If you define a signal named cursor, its value will automatically drive the CSS mouse cursor for the Vega view. For more, see the cursor signal documentation below.


The cursor Signal

By default, Vega will style the mouse pointer when it is over a mark with a defined cursor property. However, in some interactive use cases, the cursor style should persist for the entire duration of an interaction (e.g., while dragging, regardless if the cursor remains over the item where the drag initiated). For more control, Vega provides a dedicated cursor signal. When the value of this signal is set, Vega uses it in lieu of any cursor properties set on marks. If the value is set to "default", Vega resumes using the mark-based cursor property.

Nested Signals

Signals can be defined either in the top-level scope of a specification or within a group mark definition. If a signal is defined within a nested group, it is accessible only within the scope of that group; any marks, axes, legends, etc. that reference the signal must be contained within the group. If a nested signal has the same name as a signal defined in an outer scope, the new signal will override the previously defined signal.

In addition to new signal definitions, nested group marks may contain signal updates that target a signal defined in an outer scope. The "push": "outer" property indicates that, rather than create a new signal, updates should explicitly target an existing signal. Nested signal updates may not include value or update properties. The supported properties for signal updates are:


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      name
      String
      Required. The name of the signal to update.
    
    
      push
      String
      Required. To indicate an update to a signal defined in an outer scope, the push property must be set to "outer".
    
    
      description
      String
      A text description of the signal, useful for documentation.
    
    
      on
      Handler[ ]
      An array of event stream handlers for updating the signal value in response to input events.
    
  


Event Handlers

An event handler object includes an event stream definition indicating which events to respond to, and either an update expression for setting a new signal value, or an encode set for updating the mark being interacted with.


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      events
      EventStream
      Required. The events to respond to.
    
    
      update
      Expression
      An expression that is evaluated when events occur, the result then becomes the new signal value. This property is required if encode is not specified.
    
    
      encode
      String
      The name of a mark property encoding set to re-evaluate for the mark item that was the source of the input event. This property is required if update is not specified.
    
    
      force
      Boolean
      A boolean flag (default false) indicating whether or not updates that do not change the signal value should propagate. For example, if set to true and an input stream update sets the signal to its current value, downstream signals will still be notified of an update.
    
  


This signal definition increments its value upon mouseover of rect items:

{
  "name": "count",
  "value": 0,
  "on": [
    {"events": "rect:mouseover", "update": "count + 1"}
  ]
}


This signal definition invokes a custom encoding set upon mousedown and mouseup on mark items. The mark definition must include properties named "select" and "release" under the mark "encode" property.

{
  "name": "clickEncode",
  "on": [
    {"events": "*:mousedown", "encode": "select"},
    {"events": "*:mouseup", "encode": "release"}
  ]
}


Input Element Binding

The bind property binds a signal to an input element defined outside of the visualization. Vega will generate new HTML form elements and set up a two-way binding: changes to the input element will update the signal, and vice versa. Vega includes dedicated support for checkbox (single boolean value), radio (group of radio buttons), select (drop-down menu), and range (slider) input types. Alternatively, Vega can also bind directly to externally-defined input elements.


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      input
      String
      Required. The type of input element to use. The valid values are checkbox, radio, range, select, and any other legal HTML form input type.
    
    
      element
      String
      An optional CSS selector string indicating the parent element to which the input element should be added. By default, all input elements are added within the parent container of the Vega view.
    
    
      name
      String
      By default, the signal name is used to label input elements. This name property can be used to specify a custom label instead for the bound signal.
    
    
      debounce
      Number
      If defined, delays event handling until the specified milliseconds have elapsed since the last event was fired.
    
  


Radio and Select Input Properties


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      options
      Array
      Required. An array of options to select from.
    
    
      labels
      String[ ]
      ≥ 5.9 An array of label strings to represent the options values. If unspecified, the options value will be coerced to a string and used as the label.
    
    
      name
      String
      By default, the signal name is used to label input elements. This name property can be used to specify a custom label instead for the bound signal.
    
    
      debounce
      Number
      If defined, delays event handling until the specified milliseconds have elapsed since the last event was fired.
    
  


Range Input Properties


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      max
      Number
      For range inputs, sets the maximum slider value. Defaults to the larger of the signal value and 100.
    
    
      min
      Number
      For range inputs, sets the minimum slider value. Defaults to the smaller of the signal value and 0.
    
    
      step
      Number
      For range inputs, sets the minimum slider increment. If undefined, the step size will be automatically determined based on the min and max values.
    
    
      name
      String
      By default, the signal name is used to label input elements. This name property can be used to specify a custom label instead for the bound signal.
    
    
      debounce
      Number
      If defined, delays event handling until the specified milliseconds have elapsed since the last event was fired.
    
  


Other Input Types

In addition, any valid HTML input type may be used as the value of the input property. Examples include "text" (for single-line text entry), "color" (for a color picker), and "date" (for entering year, month and day).
In these cases, any extra properties defined (e.g., placeholder for "text" input) will be added as attributes of the generated HTML form element.

Binding Directly to External Elements

Rather than generate its own input elements, Vega also supports binding directly to an existing element defined externally. To do so, the input property must be undefined, and the element property must reference an existing, externally defined element.


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      element
      String
      Required. An input element that exposes a value property and supports the EventTarget interface, or a CSS selector string to such an element. When the element updates and dispatches an event, the value property will be used as the new, bound signal value. When the signal updates independent of the element, the value property will be set to the signal value and a new event will be dispatched on the element.
    
    
      event
      String
      The event (default "input") to listen for to track changes on the external element.
    
    
      debounce
      Number
      If defined, delays event handling until the specified milliseconds have elapsed since the last event was fired.\nSignals are dynamic variables that parameterize a visualization and can drive interactive behaviors.

    Event Streams
    Event streams are the primary means of modeling user input to enable dynamic, interactive visualizations. Event streams capture a sequence of input events such as mouse click, touch movement, timer ticks, or signal updates. When events that match a stream definition occur, they cause any corresponding signal event handlers to evaluate, potentially updating a signal value.

{
  "name": "signalName",
  "on": [
    {
      "events": <<event-stream-definition>>,
      "update": ...
    }
  ]
}


An event stream definition can be specified in multiple ways:


  Event stream objects indicate which events to capture.
  Event stream selectors string provide a convenient shorthand for event stream objects. For example, "rect:mouseover", "click[event.shiftKey]", or "timer{1000}".
  Signal references capture signal updates. For example, {"signal": "name"}.
  Scale references capture scale updates. For example, {"scale": "xscale"}.
  An array of multiple event stream objects, signal references, or scale references to capture.


Supported Event Types

The supported DOM event types for mark items are:


  click
  dblclick
  dragenter
  dragleave
  dragover
  keydown
  keypress
  keyup
  mousedown
  mousemove
  mouseout
  mouseover
  mouseup
  mousewheel
  touchend
  touchmove
  touchstart
  wheel


Other event types supported by the browser (e.g., resize events on the window object) may be captured from DOM elements on the same web page as the Vega visualization. The list above applies only to mark items contained within the Vega view’s scenegraph.

In addition, Vega supports a timer event, which fires a new event at a specified time interval (in milliseconds) determined by the event stream throttle property. ≥ 4.0

Event Stream Objects

A basic event stream consists of an event source and type:


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      source
      String
      The input event source. For event streams defined in the top-level scope of a Vega specification, this property defaults to "view", which monitors all input events in the current Vega view component (including those targeting the containing Canvas or SVG component itself). For event streams defined within nested scopes, this property defaults to "scope", which limits consideration to only events originating within the group in which the event stream is defined. Othe legal values include "window" for the browser window object, or a CSS selector string indicating external DOM elements. The source property is ignored if the event type is "timer".
    
    
      type
      String
      Required. The event type to monitor (e.g., "click", "keydown", "timer"). For more, see the supported event types list.
    
  


Any event stream object may also include the following properties for filtering or modifying an event stream:


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      between
      EventStream[ ]
      A two-element array of event stream objects, indicating sentinel starting and ending events. Only events that occur between these two events will be captured.
    
    
      consume
      Boolean
      A boolean flag (default false) indicating if this stream should consume the event by invoking event.preventDefault(). To control event consumption more globally, see the event handling configuration.
    
    
      filter
      Expression | Expression[ ]
      One or more filter expressions, each of which must evaluate to a truthy value in order for the event to be captured. These expressions may not reference signal values, only event properties.
    
    
      debounce
      Number
      The minimum time to wait between event occurrence and processing. If a new event arrives during a debouncing window, the debounce timer will restart and only the new event will be captured.
    
    
      markname
      String
      The unique name of a mark set for which to monitor input events. Events originating from other marks will be ignored.
    
    
      marktype
      String
      The type or marks (arc, rect, etc.) to monitor for input events. Events originating from other mark types will be ignored.
    
    
      throttle
      Number
      The minimum time in milliseconds between captured events (default 0). New events that arrive within the throttling window will be ignored. For timer events, this property determines the interval between timer ticks.
    
  


For example, to capture click events on rect marks:

{"type": "click", "marktype": "rect"}


To capture resize events on the browser window:

{"source": "window", "type": "resize"}


To capture mousedown events on image marks if the control key is pressed and the left mouse button is used:

{
  "type": "mousedown",
  "marktype": "image",
  "filter": ["event.ctrlKey", "event.button === 0"]
}


To capture mousemove events that occur between mousedown and mouseup events:

{
  "type": "mousemove",
  "between": [
    {"type": "mousedown"},
    {"type": "mouseup"}
  ]
}


To capture timer tick events every 2 seconds (2000 milliseconds):

{
  "type": "timer",
  "throttle": 2000
}


Derived Event Streams

In addition to basic streams, an event stream object can serve as input for a derived event stream.


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      stream
      EventStream
      Required. An input event stream to modify with additional parameters.
    
  


For example:

{
  "stream": {"marktype": "rect", "type": "click"},
  "filter": "event.shiftKey",
  "debounce": 500
}


Merged Event Streams

A set of event streams can also be merged together.


  
    
      Property
      Type
      Description
    
  
  
    
      merge
      EventStream[ ]
      Required. An array of event streams to merge into a single stream.
    
  


For example:

{
  "merge": [
    {"marktype": "symbol", "type": "mousedown"},
    {"marktype": "symbol", "type": "touchstart"}
  ]
}


Event Stream Selectors

An event selector is a convenient shorthand, inspired by CSS selectors, for defining an event stream of interest.

Basic Selectors

A basic selector specifies an event type, an optional event source, and optional filter expressions.

The general form of a basic selector (using a regexp-style syntax) is:

(source:)?type([filter])*({throttle(,debounce)?})?

The source property supports the following options:


  If undefined, uses the default source property (either view or scope) as described in the source property documentation.
  A valid mark type. For example, arc, image, or rect.
  A mark name prepended by @. For example, @cell. Matching items must have the name property specified in their mark definition.
  The string *, indicating any mark type, but excluding the view component itself.
  The string view or scope, indicating event scopes as described in the source property documentation.
  The string window, indicating the browser window object.
  If none of the above, source will be interpreted as a CSS selector string indicating DOM elements to monitor.


The type property must be one of the supported event types. To indicate that an input event should be consumed (i.e., that event.preventDefault() is called), include an exclamation point (!) at the end of the event type.

One or more filter expressions can be included as bracket-delimited ([]) expressions. If multiple filters are provided, they will be combined into a single filter via boolean “and”. Filter expressions may not make reference to any signals, only to the event object itself.

To throttle or debounce an event stream, add timing information in milliseconds within curly braces ({}) at the end of a selector.

Here are some examples of basic event selectors:

mousedown           // capture all mousedown events, regardless of source
*:mousedown         // mousedown events on marks, but not the view itself
rect:mousedown      // mousedown events on any rect marks
@foo:mousedown      // mousedown events on marks named 'foo'
symbol:mousedown!   // capture and consume mousedown events on symbol marks
window:mousemove    // capture mousemove events from the browser window
mousemove{100}      // throttle the stream by 100 ms
mousemove{100, 200} // also debounce the stream by 200 ms
mousemove{0, 200}   // debounce by 200 ms, but do not throttle
timer{1000}         // capture a timer tick every 1000 ms
mousemove[event.buttons] // mousemove events with any mouse button pressed
click[event.shiftKey]    // click events with the shift key pressed


Merge Selectors

To merge event streams, simply use multiple selectors separated by commas.

selector1, selector2, ...

For example, to capture both mousedown and touchstart events on path marks:

path:mousedown, path:touchstart

Between Filters

To capture events that occur between two other events, use a bracket notation.

[startSelector, stopSelector] > selector

Between filters are particularly useful to capture streams of drag events:

[rect:mousedown, window:mouseup] > window:mousemove

This example initiates a drag upon mousedown on a rect mark, then tracks the drag using events on the browser window. Using the window as the event source lets the drag continue if the mouse pointer leaves the initial rect mark or the view component.

Signal References

Event stream definitions can be signal references:

"on": [
  {
    "events": {"signal": "foo"},
    "update": "..."
  }
]


In this case, an update will be triggered whenever the signal foo changes. Signal references can be combined with event stream objects by providing an array to the events property:

"on": [
  {
    "events": [{"signal": "foo"}, {"type": "click", "marktype": "rect"}],
    "update": "..."
  }
]


Scale References

Event stream definitions can also monitor changes to scales:

"on": [
  {
    "events": {"scale": "xscale"},
    "update": "..."
  }
]


Here, an update is triggered whenever the scale xscale is modified. Scale references can be combined with signal references and event stream objects by providing an array to the events property:

"on": [
  {
    "events": [{"scale": "xscale"}, {"signal": "foo"}],
    "update": "..."
  }

mousemove{0, 200}   // debounce by 200 ms, but do not throttle
timer{1000}         // capture a timer tick every 1000 ms
mousemove[event.buttons] // mousemove events with any mouse button pressed
click[event.shiftKey]    // click events with the shift key pressed


Merge Selectors

To merge event streams, simply use multiple selectors separated by commas.

}\nTo capture timer tick events every 2 seconds (2000 milliseconds):\n{
  "type": "timer",
  "throttle": 2000
}\n{
  "type": "timer",
  "throttle": 2000
}\nDerived Event Streams\nIn addition to basic streams, an event stream object can serve as input for a derived event stream.\nRequired. An input event stream to modify with additional parameters.\n{
  "stream": {"marktype": "rect", "type": "click"},
  "filter": "event.shiftKey",
  "debounce": 500
}\n{
  "stream": {"marktype": "rect", "type": "click"},
  "filter": "event.shiftKey",
  "debounce": 500
}\nA set of event streams can also be merged together.\nRequired. An array of event streams to merge into a single stream.\n{
  "merge": [
    {"marktype": "symbol", "type": "mousedown"},
    {"marktype": "symbol", "type": "touchstart"}
  ]
}\n{
  "merge": [
    {"marktype": "symbol", "type": "mousedown"},
    {"marktype": "symbol", "type": "touchstart"}
  ]
}\nEvent Stream Selectors\nAn event selector is a convenient shorthand, inspired by CSS selectors, for defining an event stream of interest.\nA basic selector specifies an event type, an optional event source, and optional filter expressions.\nThe general form of a basic selector (using a regexp-style syntax) is:\n(source:)?type([filter])*({throttle(,debounce)?})?\nThe source property supports the following options:\nIf undefined, uses the default source property (either view or scope) as described in the source property documentation.\nsource property documentation\nA valid mark type. For example, arc, image, or rect.\nA mark name prepended by @. For example, @cell. Matching items must have the name property specified in their mark definition.\nThe string *, indicating any mark type, but excluding the view component itself.\nThe string view or scope, indicating event scopes as described in the source property documentation.\nsource property documentation\nThe string window, indicating the browser window object.\nbrowser window object\nIf none of the above, source will be interpreted as a CSS selector string indicating DOM elements to monitor.\nThe type property must be one of the supported event types. To indicate that an input event should be consumed (i.e., that event.preventDefault() is called), include an exclamation point (!) at the end of the event type.\nsupported event types\nevent.preventDefault()\nOne or more filter expressions can be included as bracket-delimited ([]) expressions. If multiple filters are provided, they will be combined into a single filter via boolean “and”. Filter expressions may not make reference to any signals, only to the event object itself.\nTo throttle or debounce an event stream, add timing information in milliseconds within curly braces ({}) at the end of a selector.\nHere are some examples of basic event selectors:\nmousedown           // capture all mousedown events, regardless of source
*:mousedown         // mousedown events on marks, but not the view itself
rect:mousedown      // mousedown events on any rect marks
@foo:mousedown      // mousedown events on marks named 'foo'
symbol:mousedown!   // capture and consume mousedown events on symbol marks
window:mousemove    // capture mousemove events from the browser window
mousemove{100}      // throttle the stream by 100 ms
mousemove{100, 200} // also debounce the stream by 200 ms
mousemove{0, 200}   // debounce by 200 ms, but do not throttle
timer{1000}         // capture a timer tick every 1000 ms
mousemove[event.buttons] // mousemove events with any mouse button pressed
click[event.shiftKey]    // click events with the shift key pressed\nmousedown           // capture all mousedown events, regardless of source
*:mousedown         // mousedown events on marks, but not the view itself
rect:mousedown      // mousedown events on any rect marks
@foo:mousedown      // mousedown events on marks named 'foo'
symbol:mousedown!   // capture and consume mousedown events on symbol marks
window:mousemove    // capture mousemove events from the browser window
mousemove{100}      // throttle the stream by 100 ms
mousemove{100, 200} // also debounce the stream by 200 ms
mousemove{0, 200}   // debounce by 200 ms, but do not throttle
timer{1000}         // capture a timer tick every 1000 ms
mousemove[event.buttons] // mousemove events with any mouse button pressed
click[event.shiftKey]    // click events with the shift key pressed\nTo merge event streams, simply use multiple selectors separated by commas.\nselector1, selector2, ...\nFor example, to capture both mousedown and touchstart events on path marks:\npath:mousedown, path:touchstart\nTo capture events that occur between two other events, use a bracket notation.\n[startSelector, stopSelector] > selector\nBetween filters are particularly useful to capture streams of drag events:\n[rect:mousedown, window:mouseup] > window:mousemove\nThis example initiates a drag upon mousedown on a rect mark, then tracks the drag using events on the browser window. Using the window as the event source lets the drag continue if the mouse pointer leaves the initial rect mark or the view component.\nEvent stream definitions can be signal references:\n"on": [
  {
    "events": {"signal": "foo"},
    "update": "..."
  }
]\n"on": [
  {
    "events": {"signal": "foo"},
    "update": "..."
  }
]\nIn this case, an update will be triggered whenever the signal foo changes. Signal references can be combined with event stream objects by providing an array to the events property:\n"on": [
  {
    "events": [{"signal": "foo"}, {"type": "click", "marktype": "rect"}],
    "update": "..."
  }
]\n"on": [
  {
    "events": [{"signal": "foo"}, {"type": "click", "marktype": "rect"}],
    "update": "..."
  }
]\nEvent stream definitions can also monitor changes to scales:\n"on": [
  {
    "events": {"scale": "xscale"},
    "update": "..."
  }
]\n"on": [
  {
    "events": {"scale": "xscale"},
    "update": "..."
  }
]\nHere, an update is triggered whenever the scale xscale is modified. Scale references can be combined with signal references and event stream objects by providing an array to the events property:\n"on": [
  {
    "events": [{"scale": "xscale"}, {"signal": "foo"}],
    "update": "..."
  }
]\n"on": [
  {
    "events": [{"scale": "xscale"}, {"signal": "foo"}],
    "update": "..."
  }
]\n\n\nVega

  Web Deployment
    
      Import Vega JavaScript
      Using the Vega View API
      Using the Vega-Embed Module
      Supporting Internet Explorer
      Content Security Policy
    
  
  Command Line Utilities
  Server-Side Deployment


Web Deployment

To deploy Vega on the web, first import the requisite JavaScript libraries. Then, use the Vega View API or the convenient Vega-Embed helper module to parse Vega specifications and add interactive visualizations to a web page.

Try Vega with Vega-Embed online and publish your own chart by forking our example Block.

Import Vega JavaScript

To use Vega on a web page you first need to load the Vega JavaScript files. The simplest option is to import the complete Vega bundle.

<head>
  <script src="https://vega.github.io/vega/vega.min.js"></script>
</head>


Loading Vega from a CDN. While the example above loads files from the Vega web site, for production deployments you will likely want to serve your own files or use a content delivery network (CDN). Vega releases are hosted on jsDelivr:

<head>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega@5"></script>
</head>


Using Vega and D3 together. The full vega.js and vega.min.js files bundle up all dependencies, including d3 modules and topojson-client. If you plan to independently use d3.js on your page, you can use a smaller Vega bundle that excludes redundant d3 files. Import d3 first, then import the smaller vega-core.min.js file to reduce the total file size. If you plan to load TopoJSON data files, you’ll need to import the topojson-client package as well.

<head>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@7"></script>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/topojson-client@3"></script>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega@5/build/vega-core.min.js"></script>
</head>


Using Vega with a bundler. If you use Vega with a bundler like rollup.js, you can import Vega as a module.

import * as vega from "vega";

Using the Vega-Embed Module

The Vega-Embed module provides a convenient method for adding either Vega or Vega-Lite visualizations to a web page. This module will take care of steps such as loading specification files from a URL and generating views with standard configuration options. In addition, you can include accompanying links to export images and view source. For more, see the Vega-Embed repository.

<head>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega@5"></script>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega-lite@5"></script>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega-embed@6"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="view"></div>
  <script>
    vegaEmbed(
      '#view',
      'https://vega.github.io/vega/examples/bar-chart.vg.json'
    );
  </script>
</body>


Back to reference

Using the Vega View API

Vega’s View component takes a parsed specification and configuration options as input and sets up an interactive web component. The View API also provides methods for streaming data updates, exporting static images, and accessing internal data for debugging purposes. For more, see the View component documentation.

<head>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega@5"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="view"></div>
  <script type="text/javascript">
    var view;

    fetch('https://vega.github.io/vega/examples/bar-chart.vg.json')
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(spec => render(spec))
      .catch(err => console.error(err));

    function render(spec) {
      view = new vega.View(vega.parse(spec), {
        renderer:  'canvas',  // renderer (canvas or svg)
        container: '#view',   // parent DOM container
        hover:     true       // enable hover processing
      });
      return view.runAsync();
    }
  </script>
</body>


Vega visualizations will be added to a parent DOM container element. This element (either a DOM object or a unique CSS selector string) must be provided  as a View constructor option or an as argument to the View initialize method. Note: Any existing content within the parent container element will be removed upon view initialization.

Vega and Content Security Policy (CSP)

By default Vega is not compliant with standard Content Security Policy (CSP), as it uses the Function constructor to generate functions defined in the Vega expression language. However, Vega allows use of alternative expression evaluators that are CSP-compliant. For more, see the expression interpreter usage documentation.

Back to reference

Command Line Utilities

The vega-cli package includes three node.js-based command line utilities – vg2pdf, vg2png, and vg2svg – for rendering static visualization images. These commands render to PDF, PNG, or SVG files, respectively.


  vg2pdf: vg2pdf [options] [input_vega_json_file] [output_pdf_file]
  vg2png: vg2png [options] [input_vega_json_file] [output_png_file]
  vg2svg: vg2svg [options] [input_vega_json_file] [output_svg_file]


If no input Vega JSON file is given, the utilities will attempt to read the file from standard input. If no output file is given, the resulting PDF, PNG, or SVG data will be written to standard output, and so can be piped into other applications.

The programs also accept the following (optional) parameters:


  -b, –base - [String] A base directory to use for data and image loading. For web retrieval, use -b http://host/data/. For files, use -b data/ (relative path) or -b file:///dir/data/ (absolute path).
  -h, –header - [Flag] Includes XML header and DOCTYPE in SVG output (vg2svg only).
  -s, –scale - [Number] [Default:1] A resolution scale factor. For example, -s 2 results in a doubling of the output resolution. For PDF or SVG, scales the output coordinate space.
  -seed, - [Number] Seed for random number generation. Allows for consistent output over random values. Internally replaces Math.random with a linear congruential generator.
  -c, –config, - [String] Provide a Vega config object. A file path string to a JSON file or .js file that exports an object.
  -f, –format, - [String] Set the number format locale. A file path string to a JSON file or .js file that exports an object.
  -t, –timeFormat, - [String] Set data/time format locale. A file path string to a JSON file or .js file that exports an object.
  -l, –loglevel - [String] Level of log messages written to standard error output. One of error, warn (default), info, or debug.
  –help - [Flag] Print usage help to the console.


To install the command line utilities, you must install the vega-cli npm package. For example, yarn global add vega-cli or npm install -g vega-cli will install the utilities for global use. If you install the package locally, the commands are accessible via your node_modules folder (./node_modules/bin/vg2png). The command line utilities depend on the node-canvas package. See below for more information about Vega and node-canvas.

All errors and logging message will be written to standard error output (stderr). To create a log file, pipe the stderr output to the desired file. For example: vg2pdf ...arguments 2> vg2pdf.log.

Examples

In the vega package, you can run the following from the command line if vega-cli is installed.

Render the bar chart example to a PNG file:

vg2png test/specs-valid/bar.vg.json bar.png


Render the bar chart example to an SVG file, including XML headers:

vg2svg -h test/specs-valid/bar.vg.json bar.svg


Render the arc example as a PDF, piped to a file via standard output:

vg2pdf test/specs-valid/arc.vg.json > arc.pdf


Render the choropleth example to a PNG file. A base directory is specified for loading data files:

vg2png -b test test/specs-valid/choropleth.vg.json > choropleth.png


Render the bar chart example to a PNG file at double resolution:

vg2png -s 2 test/specs-valid/bar.vg.json bar.png

To use Vega as a component within a larger project, first install it either directly (yarn add vega or npm install vega) or by including "vega" among the dependencies in your package.json file. In node.js JavaScript code, import Vega using require('vega'). Much like browser-based deployments, Node.js deployments leverage the Vega View API. However, server-side View instances should use the renderer type none and provide no DOM element to the initialize method.

To generate PNG images and accurately measure font metrics for text mark truncation, the node-canvas package must be installed. The vega package does not require node-canvas by default, so you must include it as an explicit dependency in your own project if you wish to use it. The vega-cli package, on the other hand, does include node-canvas as an explicit dependency.

Occasionally some system configurations may run into errors while installing node-canvas. Please consult the node-canvas documentation if you experience installation issues.

Example

var vega = require('vega');

// create a new view instance for a given Vega JSON spec
var view = new vega.View(vega.parse(spec), {renderer: 'none'});

// generate a static SVG image
view.toSVG()
  .then(function(svg) {
    // process svg string
  })
  .catch(function(err) { console.error(err); });

// generate a static PNG image
view.toCanvas()
  .then(function(canvas) {
    // process node-canvas instance
    // for example, generate a PNG stream to write
    var stream = canvas.createPNGStream();
  })
  .catch(function(err) { console.error(err); });

Web Deployment

To deploy Vega on the web, first import the requisite JavaScript libraries. Then, use the Vega View API or the convenient Vega-Embed helper module to parse Vega specifications and add interactive visualizations to a web page.

Try Vega with Vega-Embed online and publish your own chart by forking our example Block.

Import Vega JavaScript

To use Vega on a web page you first need to load the Vega JavaScript files. The simplest option is to import the complete Vega bundle.

<head>
  <script src="https://vega.github.io/vega/vega.min.js"></script>
</head>


Loading Vega from a CDN. While the example above loads files from the Vega web site, for production deployments you will likely want to serve your own files or use a content delivery network (CDN). Vega releases are hosted on jsDelivr:

<head>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega@5"></script>
</head>


Using Vega and D3 together. The full vega.js and vega.min.js files bundle up all dependencies, including d3 modules and topojson-client. If you plan to independently use d3.js on your page, you can use a smaller Vega bundle that excludes redundant d3 files. Import d3 first, then import the smaller vega-core.min.js file to reduce the total file size. If you plan to load TopoJSON data files, you’ll need to import the topojson-client package as well.

<head>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@7"></script>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/topojson-client@3"></script>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega@5/build/vega-core.min.js"></script>
</head>


Using Vega with a bundler. If you use Vega with a bundler like rollup.js, you can import Vega as a module.

import * as vega from "vega";

Using the Vega-Embed Module

The Vega-Embed module provides a convenient method for adding either Vega or Vega-Lite visualizations to a web page. This module will take care of steps such as loading specification files from a URL and generating views with standard configuration options. In addition, you can include accompanying links to export images and view source. For more, see the Vega-Embed repository.

<head>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega@5"></script>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega-lite@5"></script>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega-embed@6"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="view"></div>
  <script>
    vegaEmbed(
      '#view',
      'https://vega.github.io/vega/examples/bar-chart.vg.json'
    );
  </script>
</body>

Using the Vega View API

Vega’s View component takes a parsed specification and configuration options as input and sets up an interactive web component. The View API also provides methods for streaming data updates, exporting static images, and accessing internal data for debugging purposes. For more, see the View component documentation.

<head>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega@5"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="view"></div>
  <script type="text/javascript">
    var view;

    fetch('https://vega.github.io/vega/examples/bar-chart.vg.json')
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(spec => render(spec))
      .catch(err => console.error(err));

    function render(spec) {
      view = new vega.View(vega.parse(spec), {
        renderer:  'canvas',  // renderer (canvas or svg)
        container: '#view',   // parent DOM container
        hover:     true       // enable hover processing
      });
      return view.runAsync();
    }
  </script>
</body>


Vega visualizations will be added to a parent DOM container element. This element (either a DOM object or a unique CSS selector string) must be provided  as a View constructor option or an as argument to the View initialize method. Note: Any existing content within the parent container element will be removed upon view initialization.

Vega and Content Security Policy (CSP)

By default Vega is not compliant with standard Content Security Policy (CSP), as it uses the Function constructor to generate functions defined in the Vega expression language. However, Vega allows use of alternative expression evaluators that are CSP-compliant. For more, see the expression interpreter usage documentation.

Back to reference

Command Line Utilities

The vega-cli package includes three node.js-based command line utilities – vg2pdf, vg2png, and vg2svg – for rendering static visualization images. These commands render to PDF, PNG, or SVG files, respectively.


  vg2pdf: vg2pdf [options] [input_vega_json_file] [output_pdf_file]
  vg2png: vg2png [options] [input_vega_json_file] [output_png_file]
  vg2svg: vg2svg [options] [input_vega_json_file] [output_svg_file]


If no input Vega JSON file is given, the utilities will attempt to read the file from standard input. If no output file is given, the resulting PDF, PNG, or SVG data will be written to standard output, and so can be piped into other applications.

The programs also accept the following (optional) parameters:


  -b, –base - [String] A base directory to use for data and image loading. For web retrieval, use -b http://host/data/. For files, use -b data/ (relative path) or -b file:///dir/data/ (absolute path).
  -h, –header - [Flag] Includes XML header and DOCTYPE in SVG output (vg2svg only).
  -s, –scale - [Number] [Default:1] A resolution scale factor. For example, -s 2 results in a doubling of the output resolution. For PDF or SVG, scales the output coordinate space.
  -seed, - [Number] Seed for random number generation. Allows for consistent output over random values. Internally replaces Math.random with a linear congruential generator.
  -c, –config, - [String] Provide a Vega config object. A file path string to a JSON file or .js file that exports an object.
  -f, –format, - [String] Set the number format locale. A file path string to a JSON file or .js file that exports an object.
  -t, –timeFormat, - [String] Set data/time format locale. A file path string to a JSON file or .js file that exports an object.
  -l, –loglevel - [String] Level of log messages written to standard error output. One of error, warn (default), info, or debug.
  –help - [Flag] Print usage help to the console.


To install the command line utilities, you must install the vega-cli npm package. For example, yarn global add vega-cli or npm install -g vega-cli will install the utilities for global use. If you install the package locally, the commands are accessible via your node_modules folder (./node_modules/bin/vg2png). The command line utilities depend on the node-canvas package. See below for more information about Vega and node-canvas.

All errors and logging message will be written to standard error output (stderr). To create a log file, pipe the stderr output to the desired file. For example: vg2pdf ...arguments 2> vg2pdf.log.

Examples

In the vega package, you can run the following from the command line if vega-cli is installed.

Render the bar chart example to a PNG file:

vg2png test/specs-valid/bar.vg.json bar.png


Render the bar chart example to an SVG file, including XML headers:

vg2svg -h test/specs-valid/bar.vg.json bar.svg


Render the arc example as a PDF, piped to a file via standard output:

vg2pdf test/specs-valid/arc.vg.json > arc.pdf


Render the choropleth example to a PNG file. A base directory is specified for loading data files:

vg2png -b test test/specs-valid/choropleth.vg.json > choropleth.png


Render the bar chart example to a PNG file at double resolution:

vg2png -s 2 test/specs-valid/bar.vg.json bar.png

    About the Vega Project
    Over years working in data visualization, we’ve sought to build tools that help designers craft sophisticated graphics, including systems such as Prefuse, Protovis and D3.js. However, in the grand scheme of things, “artisanal” visualizations hand-coded by skilled designers are the exception, not the rule. The vast majority of the world’s visualizations instead are produced using end-user applications such as spreadsheets and business intelligence tools. While valuable, these tools often fall short of fully supporting the iterative, interactive process of data analysis. Improved tools could help a larger swath of people create effective visualizations and better understand their data.

The goal of the Vega project is to promote an ecosystem of usable and interoperable tools, supporting use cases ranging from exploratory data analysis to effective communication via custom visualization design.

This goal has led us to develop not a singular system, but rather a stack of tools for interactive data visualization. At the foundation of this stack is the Vega visualization grammar. Similar in spirit to how SQL provides a language for expressing database queries, Vega provides a declarative language for describing visualizations. Vega specifications include the data transformations and visual encoding rules needed to express a rich space of visualizations. Building on libraries such as D3, the Vega runtime parses specifications in a JSON format to produce interactive web-based graphics. One unique aspect of Vega is its support for declarative interaction design: instead of the “spaghetti code” of event handler callbacks, Vega treats user input (mouse movement, touch events, etc.) as first-class streaming data to drive reactive updates to a visualization.

While Vega is useful in its own right (for example, Vega is deployed on Wikipedia to define visualizations directly within wiki pages), our primary motivation is for Vega to serve as a foundation for higher-level tools. Vega provides a formal language and computational file format for representing and reasoning about visualizations. In other words, Vega provides a more convenient yet powerful means for writing programs that generate visualizations, ranging from interactive design tools to automatic chart recommendation tools. Vega provides a performant runtime and can serve as an “assembly language” for visualization, letting other tools focus on design questions rather than low-level implementation details.

    About the Vega Project
    Over years working in data visualization, we’ve sought to build tools that help designers craft sophisticated graphics, including systems such as Prefuse, Protovis and D3.js. However, in the grand scheme of things, “artisanal” visualizations hand-coded by skilled designers are the exception, not the rule. The vast majority of the world’s visualizations instead are produced using end-user applications such as spreadsheets and business intelligence tools. While valuable, these tools often fall short of fully supporting the iterative, interactive process of data analysis. Improved tools could help a larger swath of people create effective visualizations and better understand their data.

  Vega-Lite is a high-level grammar of interactive graphics. It provides a concise, declarative JSON syntax to create an expressive range of visualizations for data analysis and presentation.



  
    Vega-Lite specifications describe visualizations as encoding mappings from data to properties of graphical marks (e.g., points or bars).
    The Vega-Lite compiler automatically produces visualization components including axes, legends, and scales.
    It determines default properties of these components based on a set of carefully designed rules.
    This approach allows Vega-Lite specifications to be concise for quick visualization authoring, while giving user control to override defaults and customize various parts of a visualization.
    As we also designed Vega-Lite to support data analysis, Vega-Lite supports both data transformations (e.g., aggregation, binning, filtering, sorting) and visual transformations (e.g., stacking and faceting).
    Moreover, Vega-Lite specifications can be composed into layered and multi-view displays, and made interactive with selections.

Compared to Vega, Vega-Lite provides a more concise and convenient form to author common visualizations. As Vega-Lite can compile its specifications to Vega specifications, users may use Vega-Lite as the primary visualization tool and, if needed, transition to use the lower-level Vega for advanced use cases.

Example


  
    With Vega-Lite, we can start with a bar chart of the average monthly precipitation in Seattle, overlay a rule for the overall yearly average, and have it represent an interactive moving average for a dragged region.

                The Vega projects provide an ecosystem of tools for declarative data visualizations. 
                The various components of this ecosystem build on each other providing different levels of abstraction.
            
            
                Vega is a NumFocus sponsored project.

                        is a visualization grammar, a declarative language for creating, saving, and sharing interactive visualization designs. With
                        Vega, you can describe the visual appearance and interactive behavior of a visualization in a JSON
                        format, and generate web-based views using HTML5 Canvas or SVG.

   By setting the point property of the line mark definition to an object defining a property of the overlaying point marks, we can overlay point markers on top of line.

Notes: (1) This is equivalent to adding another layer of point marks. 
 (2) While "point" marks are normally semi-transparent, the overlay point marker has opacity = 1 by default.
