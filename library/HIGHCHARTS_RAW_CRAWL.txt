Highcharts® PythonHighcharts for Python is a collection of Python libraries that gives you access to all the rich features of Highcharts Core, Stock, Maps and Gantt via a simple, Pythonic API. Try for Free Buy NowNeed technical assistance? Click here for Python support.Key FeaturesComprehensive Highcharts Support Highcharts for Python, provides the full set of rich options, customizations, and interactivity provided by the Highcharts JavaScript libraries. Eliminating the need for “piecing together” partial solutions from unmaintained community libraries. Using a simple Pythonic API, the toolkit makes tapping into Highcharts features fast and simple - “batteries included” with full support for rich callback and formatter functions, SVG extensions, and more.Simple and Powerful Pythonic API Highcharts for Python does the heavy lifting of providing a truly Pythonic API. No need to rely on “hacky” solutions involving gigantic Python dict's, JSON files that only support part of the Highcharts JavaScript capabilities, or switching back and forth between Pythonic snake_case and JavaScript camelCase.Simple UI Integration Highcharts for Python is designed to simplify the integration of your (often back-end) Python code with your UI code. With one method call, you can generate the full set of JavaScript code that should be rendered by your UI to display the fully-configured data visualizations your applications need.Easy and Consistent Chart Downloads Download static versions of your data visualizations using all of their Highcharts formatting and configuration with just one method call. Easily export your charts to PNG, JPG, PDF, SVG, and more.Native Integration with the Python Ecosystem Using Highcharts for Python, you can easily integrate rich Highcharts visualizations into your Python stack taking advantage of native integrations with:Jupyter Labs/Jupyter NotebooksPandasPySparkGeoPandasand moreUsing the Python toolkit, you can easily leverage Highcharts in your exploratory data analysis (EDA) workflows, and use popular components of the modern data stack such as Databricks.Main Features   Work Where Your Data Lives Easily configure highly interactive rich data visualizations in your Python code – where you manage the data, anyway – and deliver those visualizations to your rendering layer with one method call. No need to maintain complicated custom serialization logic, or split your visualization configurations across multiple applications. Keep it simple by managing your visualization where you manage your data.  Works With Your Stack Highcharts for Python integrates with the most popular components of the Python data science ecosystem. Every Highcharts visualization can be constructed from a Pandas or PySpark DataFrame with one method call, and then rendered in Jupyter Labs/Notebooks using another method call.  Highcharts without the JavaScript Highcharts is a well-known JavaScript visualization library, but not everyone on your team works in JavaScript. Highcharts for Python translates the full set of JavaScript capabilities into a Pythonic form, using Python snake_case naming conventions, Python import conventions, standard class names, method patterns, etc. Don’t worry about learning JavaScript – Highcharts for Python lets you build the same powerful visualizations while working in Python.  Highly Configurable Using the Highcharts for Python library, you can configure custom styling, custom configuration, and custom logic for your data visualizations. Easily add custom event handlers, formatter functions, and JavaScript callback functions to give your audience the data experience they need.  One-Call Chart Download Having configured a beautiful, accessible, and easy-to-understand data visualization you (or your code) can now download it using one method call. Automatic integration with either the Highsoft-provided Highcharts Export Server, or with your own custom Highcharts Export Server deployed in your own environment.  What You Need, When You Need It Highcharts for Python consists of different Python libraries, each corresponding to one of the Highcharts JavaScript libraries or providing a specific niche capability. This lets you only install the code you need, minimizing and simplifying your dependencies.

This means colors don't have to be parsed and analyzed in order to allow tweening and modification. Which means full support for CSS variables, named colors and all color definitions known to the browser. Read more in the docs.Added experimental flag, HTMLElement.useForeignObject. When true, labels with the useHTML flag are rendered inside a <foreignObject> in SVG, instead of the traditional parallel div structure.Added ESM bundles for dynamic imports. Use highcharts/esm/highcharts.js or load from our CDN.Added new options, tooltip.fixed and tooltip.position, as a simple declarative way of keeping the tooltip fixed.Added the nullInteraction option for more series types than before. Null points will now support data labels and tooltips.Added language modules for some selected languages, as well as a structure to continue building on.Added level headers in treemap as separate cells through the dataLabels.headers option.

Removed the internal Series properties xData, yData, processedXData and processedYData, as well as some additional series-specific data arrays, in favor of Series.dataTable.Added support for data.x values as date strings. These can now be defined for example as '2024-10-03' as a more human readable alternative to timestamps. Also allowed date string in other options referring to x values, like xAxis.min, xAxis.max, series.pointStart, plotLines.value, Gantt series start and end, Axis.setExtremes() etc.Refactored all internal time zone handling with functions powered by Intl.DateTimeFormat.Added new option, lang.locale, to determine in what language dates are rendered.Added support for locale-aware date formatting through the Intl.DateTimeFormat browser API. Changed all default datetime format strings to locale-aware formats.Added ucfirst template helper function to allow upper case first in strings.Added support for string parameters in template helper functions.Added support for textOverflow: 'ellipsis' with texts and labels spanning multiple lines, as well as the lineClamp CSS property.

See #21648.  Upgrade notes When importing Highcharts as a node module, additional modules no longer require initialization. Previously modules would be first imported, then initialized:// Imports for Highcharts v11
import * as Highcharts from 'highcharts';
import addAccessibility from 'highcharts/modules/accessibility';

addAccessibility(Highcharts); // <== This no longer works!
Since v12, the module will not return a factory function, so above code will cause an error. Instead, import it like this:// Imports for Highcharts v12
import * as Highcharts from 'highcharts';
import 'highcharts/modules/accessibility';
See the elaborate article in the docs.All date and time strings are now by default rendered in the web page's default language as set in the html.lang attribute, or falls back to the browser default. Setting lang.locale to en-GB will restore the labels approximately as they were prior to v12. For exact backwards compatibility, set all the time format options (xAxis.dateTimeLabelFormats, tooltip.dateTimeLabelFormats etc) back to their v11 defaults in addition.The time.getTimezoneOffset function callback no longer works. Instead, use the timezone option.All time-related options in the global group were removed. Use the time options instead.The data handling of the Series class has been rewritten to use the DataTable class directly. As a consequence, the parallel arrays storing the series data are removed, and replaced by Series.getColumn().Series.xData is replaced by Series.getColumn('x')Series.yData is replaced by Series.getColumn('y')Series.processedXData is replaced by Series.getColumn('x', true)Series.processedYData is replaced by Series.getColumn('y', true)The "Download PDF" menu item was removed from the default exporting menu, in preparation for a future update where exporting is done on the client side by default. The future update will require PDF download to either run via the export server like before, or to load a third party script. To re-enable the PDF download in the menu, add downloadPDF in the contextButton.menuItems.The HighchartModuleLoaded window event is no longer supported as we moved to webpack builds with tree shaking capabilites. Instead, extensions must rely on events and wrapped methods.The title.widthAdjust option is removed. Instead, use contextButton.buttonSpacing to make space for non-default context button.Titles and subtitles now have adaptive alignment. To revert to the pre-v12 defaults, set title.align and subtitle.align to center, and title.minScale to 1.The Point instances are now used as context for tooltip and data label formatters and format strings, instead of an abstract context object. In most cases this will cause no changes as the properties of the context object are now moved to the Point itself, but some changes may occur. Specifically the {point.x} key for points on a category axes will no longer return the category name. Instead, use {category}.  Bug fixes Fixed #21793, templating did not correctly parse sub expressions inside nested if conditions.Fixed #22188, graphs were clipped at the left side when zooming on a series containing zones, and the x-axis was of type category.Fixed #20550, centerInCategory did not work with multiple stacks.Changed default exporting.url to a more stable server, dedicated to SVG export only.Fixed #22187, word wrap failed for SVG when a word with markup fell at the breaking point.Fixed #22100, pie data label was cut off in some cases when rendered at the bottom of the pie. Altered positioning logic by letting labels gravitate towards the sides when there is space available, which also leaves room for the pie to render larger in limited space.Fixed #19335, accessibility focus border was incorrectly positioned in some edge cases.Fixed #21863, a regression causing the Boost module to fail with treemap series.Fixed #21890, scrollablePlotArea was not supporting parallelCoordinates.Fixed #21684, tooltip with outside did not receive css themes assigned to container.Fixed #21924, custom sizes in marker states did not work.Fixed #21098, corrections for ie11 compatibility fix.Fixed #21136, pointer events were called on points outside of plot area with scrollablePlotArea enabled.Fixed #21267, a regression causing elements to disappear when zooming on an X-range chart.Fixed #21804, columns were crisped to full pixel width even when the crisp option was explicitly false.Fixed #16931, errors in Chrome when modifying chart before printing the page.Fixed #21745, click event was fired on drag for multiple charts.Fixed #21530, tick values were padded onto user-defined category axes.Fixed #18461, changes to options3d alpha and beta were not applied to pie body.Fixed #21534, mouseover point event broke drilldown.Fixed #20470, allow values from nested properties in exported data.  Highcharts v11.4.8 (2024-08-29) #   Bug fixes Fixed #21165, series didn't render properly when the chart height was very large.Fixed #21106, series clipped on boost disabled and increased the chart size.Fixed #21734, minor ticks were wrongly distributed with multiple axes or when tickAmount was set.Fixed #21521, plot band labels and plot line labels would overlap if positioned too close. Added inside and allowOverlap options to the Axis.plotBands.label options.Fixed #20499, data labels failed to apply width in styled mode.Fixed #21205, offline PDF exporting was broken by attempted erroneous child node removal when the chart contained text paths.Fixed #21241, accessibility could not be dynamically enabled or disabled.Fixed #21188 and #21510, hidden divs with special CSS styles increased chart height by firing ResizeObserver.Fixed #21650, the data module was not successfully updating the x-axis in some cases.Fixed #21255, tooltip with outside rendered outside viewport, making document.documentElement expand.Fixed #21605, legend text was not vertically aligned with the symbol.

Highcharts v11.4.6 (2024-07-08) #   Bug fixes Fixed #21470, bad require tagging causing bad module references.  Highcharts v11.4.5 (2024-07-04) #   Bug fixes Fixed #21446, a regression causing broken imports of modules due to bad relative paths.Fixed #21445, generated TypeScript declarations for deprecated option series.events.legendItemClick.  Highcharts v11.4.4 (2024-07-02) # Refactored the series.turboThreshold option to be more forgiving. Instead of failing with a warning message, the Series class now silently skips the fast looping of raw numbers and processes the object configuration instead, at a slight performance cost.Introduced new event and option legend.events.itemClick, deprecated events.legendItemClick. See #3957.Added new option treemap.traverseToLeaf which allows to drill into last possible leaf of Treemap series.  Upgrade notes Text path support is no longer part of the highcharts.js main bundle, but requires loading the modules/textpath.js bundle. It is however built into those series that use text paths by default.  Bug fixes Temporarily fixed #21144, workaround for a Chromium bug while touching and scrolling chart.Fixed #21098, various minor fixes for IE11 compatibility.Fixed #21302, added the description to all arguments in the Tooltip constructor.Fixed #20525, in boosted charts, markers were not being hidden when zoomed in series was hidden.Fixed #21174, stack labels were wrongly positioned for multiple x-axes in inverted charts.Fixed #21341, updating the height of a SVGLabel didn't occur immediately.Fixed #19224, treegraph data labels did not hide when allowOverlap was false.

Added the option to set tooltip.animation as an animation object, not just a boolean as previously.Added new options pane.background.borderRadius, and plotBands.borderRadius for gauges.  Bug fixes Fixed #20451, legend.symbolWidth and legend.symbolHeight didn't change color axis dimensions if colorAxis.width or colorAxis.height were not set.Fixed #20876, redraw and drillupall events were called too many times during chart drill up.Fixed #5334, pixel alignment issues between grid lines, column series, error bars and scatter points.Fixed #20585, gap in the border at the bottom of bubbles at some sizes.Fixed #20729, pressing "enter" on a tabbed point resulted in different event than clicking it with a mouse.Fixed chart height docs, updated 500px-sample title, and added new demo showing height inherited from container.Fixed #18776, the series colors were not found when boosting multiple series in a single canvas in styled mode.Fixed #21125, a regression causing wrong positioning of bubbles in an inverted bubble chart.Fixed #20564, minus sign was displayed for the number zero if it was rounded from a negative value.Fixed #20816, time zone wasn't respected in Templating in format strings.Fixed #20804, setOptions didn't change radial axis defaults.Fixed #20146, dragging didn't work for the errorbar series.Fixed #20988, exporting chart, then dragging an annotation and exporting again used to cause wrong annotation position in the subsequently exported charts.Improved the default padding of axis labels, and fixed their collision calculations.Fixed #20998, data labels overflowed the plot area when the axis position was different from default.Fixed #20405, a regression in network graph.

See #13065.Added language options for export-data table text, see #13166.Added ability to set markers of heatmap points to a custom shapes defined within SVGRenderer.prototype.symbols object, see #12508.  Upgrade notes The Axis class was refactored as part of the TypeScript migration. Axis extensions like log axis, broken axis, parallel axis, datetime axis and ordinal axis are now handled as compositions. Instead of adding multiple properties to the main axis instance, they now add a single object that holds all properties. This does not affect the options API, but it may affect implementations that are based on some of our samples that used the original properties. Our samples have been updated to use the new structure.For added type safety, we are now defining SVG path definition as two-dimensional arrays, or in TypeScript sense an array of tuples. So ['M', 0, 0, 'L', 100, 100] in the new implementation should be written [['M', 0, 0], ['L', 100, 100]]. We built in a converter for old paths, but there may be cases, like for example directly accessing SVGRenderer.crispLine, where it breaks.

Upgrade notes Legend positioning: Since version 2.1 Highcharts is aware of the size of the titles and legend and will try to make room for these in the chart's margins.

This means colors don't have to be parsed and analyzed in order to allow tweening and modification. Which means full support for CSS variables, named colors and all color definitions known to the browser. Read more in the docs.Added experimental flag, HTMLElement.useForeignObject.

Removed the internal Series properties xData, yData, processedXData and processedYData, as well as some additional series-specific data arrays, in favor of Series.dataTable.Added support for data.x values as date strings. These can now be defined for example as '2024-10-03' as a more human readable alternative to timestamps. Also allowed date string in other options referring to x values, like xAxis.min, xAxis.max, series.pointStart, plotLines.value, Gantt series start and end, Axis.setExtremes() etc.Refactored all internal time zone handling with functions powered by Intl.DateTimeFormat.Added new option, lang.locale, to determine in what language dates are rendered.Added support for locale-aware date formatting through the Intl.DateTimeFormat browser API.

See #21648.  Upgrade notes When importing Highcharts as a node module, additional modules no longer require initialization. Previously modules would be first imported, then initialized:// Imports for Highcharts v11
import * as Highcharts from 'highcharts';
import addAccessibility from 'highcharts/modules/accessibility';

addAccessibility(Highcharts); // <== This no longer works!
Since v12, the module will not return a factory function, so above code will cause an error. Instead, import it like this:// Imports for Highcharts v12
import * as Highcharts from 'highcharts';
import 'highcharts/modules/accessibility';
See the elaborate article in the docs.All date and time strings are now by default rendered in the web page's default language as set in the html.lang attribute, or falls back to the browser default. Setting lang.locale to en-GB will restore the labels approximately as they were prior to v12. For exact backwards compatibility, set all the time format options (xAxis.dateTimeLabelFormats, tooltip.dateTimeLabelFormats etc) back to their v11 defaults in addition.The time.getTimezoneOffset function callback no longer works. Instead, use the timezone option.All time-related options in the global group were removed. Use the time options instead.The data handling of the Series class has been rewritten to use the DataTable class directly. As a consequence, the parallel arrays storing the series data are removed, and replaced by Series.getColumn().Series.xData is replaced by Series.getColumn('x')Series.yData is replaced by Series.getColumn('y')Series.processedXData is replaced by Series.getColumn('x', true)Series.processedYData is replaced by Series.getColumn('y', true)The "Download PDF" menu item was removed from the default exporting menu, in preparation for a future update where exporting is done on the client side by default. The future update will require PDF download to either run via the export server like before, or to load a third party script. To re-enable the PDF download in the menu, add downloadPDF in the contextButton.menuItems.The HighchartModuleLoaded window event is no longer supported as we moved to webpack builds with tree shaking capabilites. Instead, extensions must rely on events and wrapped methods.The title.widthAdjust option is removed. Instead, use contextButton.buttonSpacing to make space for non-default context button.Titles and subtitles now have adaptive alignment. To revert to the pre-v12 defaults, set title.align and subtitle.align to center, and title.minScale to 1.The Point instances are now used as context for tooltip and data label formatters and format strings, instead of an abstract context object. In most cases this will cause no changes as the properties of the context object are now moved to the Point itself, but some changes may occur. Specifically the {point.x} key for points on a category axes will no longer return the category name. Instead, use {category}.  Bug fixes Fixed #21793, templating did not correctly parse sub expressions inside nested if conditions.Fixed #22188, graphs were clipped at the left side when zooming on a series containing zones, and the x-axis was of type category.Fixed #20550, centerInCategory did not work with multiple stacks.Changed default exporting.url to a more stable server, dedicated to SVG export only.Fixed #22187, word wrap failed for SVG when a word with markup fell at the breaking point.Fixed #22100, pie data label was cut off in some cases when rendered at the bottom of the pie. Altered positioning logic by letting labels gravitate towards the sides when there is space available, which also leaves room for the pie to render larger in limited space.Fixed #19335, accessibility focus border was incorrectly positioned in some edge cases.Fixed #21863, a regression causing the Boost module to fail with treemap series.Fixed #21890, scrollablePlotArea was not supporting parallelCoordinates.Fixed #21684, tooltip with outside did not receive css themes assigned to container.Fixed #21924, custom sizes in marker states did not work.Fixed #21098, corrections for ie11 compatibility fix.Fixed #21136, pointer events were called on points outside of plot area with scrollablePlotArea enabled.Fixed #21267, a regression causing elements to disappear when zooming on an X-range chart.Fixed #21804, columns were crisped to full pixel width even when the crisp option was explicitly false.Fixed #16931, errors in Chrome when modifying chart before printing the page.Fixed #21745, click event was fired on drag for multiple charts.Fixed #21530, tick values were padded onto user-defined category axes.Fixed #18461, changes to options3d alpha and beta were not applied to pie body.Fixed #21534, mouseover point event broke drilldown.Fixed #20470, allow values from nested properties in exported data.  Highcharts v11.4.8 (2024-08-29) #   Bug fixes Fixed #21165, series didn't render properly when the chart height was very large.Fixed #21106, series clipped on boost disabled and increased the chart size.Fixed #21734, minor ticks were wrongly distributed with multiple axes or when tickAmount was set.Fixed #21521, plot band labels and plot line labels would overlap if positioned too close. Added inside and allowOverlap options to the Axis.plotBands.label options.Fixed #20499, data labels failed to apply width in styled mode.Fixed #21205, offline PDF exporting was broken by attempted erroneous child node removal when the chart contained text paths.Fixed #21241, accessibility could not be dynamically enabled or disabled.Fixed #21188 and #21510, hidden divs with special CSS styles increased chart height by firing ResizeObserver.Fixed #21650, the data module was not successfully updating the x-axis in some cases.Fixed #21255, tooltip with outside rendered outside viewport, making document.documentElement expand.Fixed #21605, legend text was not vertically aligned with the symbol.  Highcharts v11.4.7 (2024-08-14) #   Bug fixes Fixed #21554, tab navigation was trapped in a loop after printing the chart.Fixed #20456, boosted heatmaps were not rendering in some cases.Fixed #21501, #21547 and #21569, various tooltip and interaction issues caused by a temporary pointerEvents fix for older Chromium.Fixed #21277, version and other metadata was not being replaced after building esm-modules.Fixed #21429, the rounded solid gauge series was misaligned when close to 100%.Fixed #21281, hovering line with split tooltip, then scatter, caused tooltip animation to start in top-left.Fixed #17854 , fillOpacity was too strong in boosted series.Fixed #9748, the mouseup event was not respected after setting the event.Fixed #21315 inverted bubble point halos were not positioned correctly.  Highcharts v11.4.6 (2024-07-08) #   Bug fixes Fixed #21470, bad require tagging causing bad module references.  Highcharts v11.4.5 (2024-07-04) #   Bug fixes Fixed #21446, a regression causing broken imports of modules due to bad relative paths.Fixed #21445, generated TypeScript declarations for deprecated option series.events.legendItemClick.  Highcharts v11.4.4 (2024-07-02) # Refactored the series.turboThreshold option to be more forgiving. Instead of failing with a warning message, the Series class now silently skips the fast looping of raw numbers and processes the object configuration instead, at a slight performance cost.Introduced new event and option legend.events.itemClick, deprecated events.legendItemClick. See #3957.Added new option treemap.traverseToLeaf which allows to drill into last possible leaf of Treemap series.  Upgrade notes Text path support is no longer part of the highcharts.js main bundle, but requires loading the modules/textpath.js bundle. It is however built into those series that use text paths by default.  Bug fixes Temporarily fixed #21144, workaround for a Chromium bug while touching and scrolling chart.Fixed #21098, various minor fixes for IE11 compatibility.Fixed #21302, added the description to all arguments in the Tooltip constructor.Fixed #20525, in boosted charts, markers were not being hidden when zoomed in series was hidden.Fixed #21174, stack labels were wrongly positioned for multiple x-axes in inverted charts.Fixed #21341, updating the height of a SVGLabel didn't occur immediately.Fixed #19224, treegraph data labels did not hide when allowOverlap was false. Implemented overlap detection for labels with text path.Fixed #21177, setting data to a hidden packed bubble series would throw error.Fixed #21124, special character broke string label templating format.Fixed regression after fix #20435, updating of existing point event didn't remove the old event.Fixed #20969, tooltip did not dissappear when hovering from one chart to another.Fixed #21245, points were wrongly positioned for multiple boxplot series.Fixed #20494, chart did not switch back to default config upon exiting responsive conditions.Fixed #21176, in boosted charts, the halo was wrongly animated for multiple series with multiple axes.Fixed #19944, error message "getAttribute is not a function" appeared in certain edge cases in Firefox.Fixed #16925, stacked area series with null data produced bad animation.Fixed #11794, max rendered series.lineWidth for boost was 1.

See #13330.Added new series label options, series.label.format and series.label.formatter.Added individual dash style settings for various parts of box plots. See #13065.Added language options for export-data table text, see #13166.Added ability to set markers of heatmap points to a custom shapes defined within SVGRenderer.prototype.symbols object, see #12508.  Upgrade notes The Axis class was refactored as part of the TypeScript migration. Axis extensions like log axis, broken axis, parallel axis, datetime axis and ordinal axis are now handled as compositions. Instead of adding multiple properties to the main axis instance, they now add a single object that holds all properties. This does not affect the options API, but it may affect implementations that are based on some of our samples that used the original properties. Our samples have been updated to use the new structure.For added type safety, we are now defining SVG path definition as two-dimensional arrays, or in TypeScript sense an array of tuples. So ['M', 0, 0, 'L', 100, 100] in the new implementation should be written [['M', 0, 0], ['L', 100, 100]]. We built in a converter for old paths, but there may be cases, like for example directly accessing SVGRenderer.crispLine, where it breaks.

Upgrade notes Legend positioning: Since version 2.1 Highcharts is aware of the size of the titles and legend and will try to make room for these in the chart's margins. When upgrading from older versions, this may lead to too great margins depending on where your legend is positioned. To prevent this, set a new option, floating to true in your legend options. Furthermore, the x and y values of the legend position is now relative to the chart.spacingTop and chart.spacingLeft etc. properties instead of the chart's outer edge.

Removed the internal Series properties xData, yData, processedXData and processedYData, as well as some additional series-specific data arrays, in favor of Series.dataTable.Added support for data.x values as date strings. These can now be defined for example as '2024-10-03' as a more human readable alternative to timestamps. Also allowed date string in other options referring to x values, like xAxis.min, xAxis.max, series.pointStart, plotLines.value, Gantt series start and end, Axis.setExtremes() etc.Refactored all internal time zone handling with functions powered by Intl.DateTimeFormat.Added new option, lang.locale, to determine in what language dates are rendered.Added support for locale-aware date formatting through the Intl.DateTimeFormat browser API. Changed all default datetime format strings to locale-aware formats.Added ucfirst template helper function to allow upper case first in strings.Added support for string parameters in template helper functions.Added support for textOverflow: 'ellipsis' with texts and labels spanning multiple lines, as well as the lineClamp CSS property.

See #21648.  Upgrade notes When importing Highcharts as a node module, additional modules no longer require initialization. Previously modules would be first imported, then initialized:// Imports for Highcharts v11
import * as Highcharts from 'highcharts';
import addAccessibility from 'highcharts/modules/accessibility';

addAccessibility(Highcharts); // <== This no longer works!
Since v12, the module will not return a factory function, so above code will cause an error. Instead, import it like this:// Imports for Highcharts v12
import * as Highcharts from 'highcharts';
import 'highcharts/modules/accessibility';
See the elaborate article in the docs.All date and time strings are now by default rendered in the web page's default language as set in the html.lang attribute, or falls back to the browser default. Setting lang.locale to en-GB will restore the labels approximately as they were prior to v12. For exact backwards compatibility, set all the time format options (xAxis.dateTimeLabelFormats, tooltip.dateTimeLabelFormats etc) back to their v11 defaults in addition.The time.getTimezoneOffset function callback no longer works. Instead, use the timezone option.All time-related options in the global group were removed. Use the time options instead.The data handling of the Series class has been rewritten to use the DataTable class directly. As a consequence, the parallel arrays storing the series data are removed, and replaced by Series.getColumn().Series.xData is replaced by Series.getColumn('x')Series.yData is replaced by Series.getColumn('y')Series.processedXData is replaced by Series.getColumn('x', true)Series.processedYData is replaced by Series.getColumn('y', true)The "Download PDF" menu item was removed from the default exporting menu, in preparation for a future update where exporting is done on the client side by default. The future update will require PDF download to either run via the export server like before, or to load a third party script. To re-enable the PDF download in the menu, add downloadPDF in the contextButton.menuItems.The HighchartModuleLoaded window event is no longer supported as we moved to webpack builds with tree shaking capabilites. Instead, extensions must rely on events and wrapped methods.The title.widthAdjust option is removed. Instead, use contextButton.buttonSpacing to make space for non-default context button.Titles and subtitles now have adaptive alignment. To revert to the pre-v12 defaults, set title.align and subtitle.align to center, and title.minScale to 1.The Point instances are now used as context for tooltip and data label formatters and format strings, instead of an abstract context object. In most cases this will cause no changes as the properties of the context object are now moved to the Point itself, but some changes may occur. Specifically the {point.x} key for points on a category axes will no longer return the category name. Instead, use {category}.  Bug fixes Fixed #21793, templating did not correctly parse sub expressions inside nested if conditions.Fixed #22188, graphs were clipped at the left side when zooming on a series containing zones, and the x-axis was of type category.Fixed #20550, centerInCategory did not work with multiple stacks.Changed default exporting.url to a more stable server, dedicated to SVG export only.Fixed #22187, word wrap failed for SVG when a word with markup fell at the breaking point.Fixed #22100, pie data label was cut off in some cases when rendered at the bottom of the pie. Altered positioning logic by letting labels gravitate towards the sides when there is space available, which also leaves room for the pie to render larger in limited space.Fixed #19335, accessibility focus border was incorrectly positioned in some edge cases.Fixed #21863, a regression causing the Boost module to fail with treemap series.Fixed #21890, scrollablePlotArea was not supporting parallelCoordinates.Fixed #21684, tooltip with outside did not receive css themes assigned to container.Fixed #21924, custom sizes in marker states did not work.Fixed #21098, corrections for ie11 compatibility fix.Fixed #21136, pointer events were called on points outside of plot area with scrollablePlotArea enabled.Fixed #21267, a regression causing elements to disappear when zooming on an X-range chart.Fixed #21804, columns were crisped to full pixel width even when the crisp option was explicitly false.Fixed #16931, errors in Chrome when modifying chart before printing the page.Fixed #21745, click event was fired on drag for multiple charts.Fixed #21530, tick values were padded onto user-defined category axes.Fixed #18461, changes to options3d alpha and beta were not applied to pie body.Fixed #21534, mouseover point event broke drilldown.Fixed #20470, allow values from nested properties in exported data.

Highcharts v8.1.0 (2020-05-05) # Added vertical panning to Highcharts. The chart.panning.type now accepts y directions.Added box options for yAxis.stackLabels: backgroundColor, borderWidth, borderRadius and borderColor. See #13330.Added new series label options, series.label.format and series.label.formatter.Added individual dash style settings for various parts of box plots. See #13065.Added language options for export-data table text, see #13166.Added ability to set markers of heatmap points to a custom shapes defined within SVGRenderer.prototype.symbols object, see #12508.  Upgrade notes The Axis class was refactored as part of the TypeScript migration. Axis extensions like log axis, broken axis, parallel axis, datetime axis and ordinal axis are now handled as compositions. Instead of adding multiple properties to the main axis instance, they now add a single object that holds all properties. This does not affect the options API, but it may affect implementations that are based on some of our samples that used the original properties. Our samples have been updated to use the new structure.For added type safety, we are now defining SVG path definition as two-dimensional arrays, or in TypeScript sense an array of tuples. So ['M', 0, 0, 'L', 100, 100] in the new implementation should be written [['M', 0, 0], ['L', 100, 100]]. We built in a converter for old paths, but there may be cases, like for example directly accessing SVGRenderer.crispLine, where it breaks.

Upgrade notes Legend positioning: Since version 2.1 Highcharts is aware of the size of the titles and legend and will try to make room for these in the chart's margins. When upgrading from older versions, this may lead to too great margins depending on where your legend is positioned. To prevent this, set a new option, floating to true in your legend options. Furthermore, the x and y values of the legend position is now relative to the chart.spacingTop and chart.spacingLeft etc. properties instead of the chart's outer edge.

What is the scope of an Educational or Personal License?  An Education or Personal license grants you the right to use Highcharts software in your non-commercial projects for one year. The scope of the license covers public and private websites (including subdomains and intranets) hosted on servers you own or control. When using 
our software in these environments, your Highcharts-generated content must appear the same for all users and cannot be customized based on any 
user’s personal data. The Education or Personal license scope also includes the right to use Highcharts software in one non-commercial Web or SaaS application, 
where you may tailor your Highcharts-generated content based on the personal data of individual users. An Education or Personal license does not give you the right to distribute our software. This means if your SaaS or Web application includes Highcharts software, 
it cannot be installed and hosted by a third party, regardless of the third party’s non-commercial status. Any attempt to do so violates the terms of the license.  What does "non-commercial" mean?  Our definition of non-commercial means any activity that does not result in a for-profit product intended for distribution to third parties, 
regardless of their non-commercial status. Non-commercial use of our software is limited to educational purposes and personal use.  How many users does the Educational License cover?

Are there any limitations on marketing my non-commercial product(s)?  As long as you retain the Highcharts watermark and don’t give the impression that your product (with our software) can be downloaded and/or distributed commercially, you’re good to go. We also reserve the right to showcase your product on our website and will work with you to make sure we feature your product and brand accurately.  How long does an Education/Personal license last?

If you don’t want to apply for another license term, you must cease using our software when your current license expires.  Who determines if my project is non-commercial?  We do. If, after granting you an Education or Personal license, we determine that your project no longer meets our non-commercial criteria, we will revoke your license, and you will no longer have the right to use our software.  Can I transfer my license to someone else?  No. Education/Personal licenses are not transferable.  What if my non-commercial project/product becomes commercial?  If you decide to turn your product or project commercial, your Highcharts software usage will no longer be covered by your Education/Personal license. You will be in violation of your license and must purchase a commercial license to continue using our software.

Know Your Data
 TypeKnowing what kind of data
 you
 are
 dealing
 with is an
 essential phase to
 better
 extract insights from the data; since for each data type, you need
 to
 use
 the
 right mathematical techniques and visualization types.Categorical Data is labeled categorical if their
 values
 describe a
 quality,
 grade, level,
 or
 any other characteristics. Categorical data can be Nominal or
 Ordinal.Ordinal Ordered variables
 where
 the
 number of units in each variable
 is not the same. Show

 of
 Ordinal DataData is ordinal if it represents an ordered
 quality
 variable, and the
 number of units in each variable is not the same. LevelsOn

 Nominal DataNominal data is a type of categorical data
 where
 the
 order
 doesn't matter. Gender Countries' names ColorsTip:  To identify nominal data, ask
 yourself
 the
 following
 question: Will the meaning change if I
 change
 the
 variables'
 order? If not, you have nominal data.Continuous Data is labeled continuous if
 the
 values
 are
 measured.
 Continuous
 data could
 be
 either interval or ratio.Interval  Data where
 proportion
 doesn't
 make sense, and the zero has no meaning. Show

 proportion
 doesn't
 make sense, and the zero has no meaning. Intelligence

 objective2. Define your Objective There are many objectives to visualize a data set. Here are the main
 commonly
 used
 objectives: ComparisonComparison estimates the similarities or
 not
 between
 two or
 more elements. Line, Bar, Bubble charts, and Treemaps are
 often
 used
 to
 compare categorical data. Composition Composition shows the continuent parts of an element. Donut,
 Pie,
 Stacked
 Bar, and Stacked Column charts are often used to visualize
 composition. Relationship Relationship demonstrates how one variable affects other
 variables.
 Scatter
 and Bubble charts are often used to visualize relationship. Hierarchy The hierarchy is a system where elements are arranged or
 ranked
 one
 above
 another. Treemap, Sunburst, and Circle chart are used to
 visualize
 hierarchy. Distribution Distribution depicts the frequency of a variable through
 time or
 space.
 Scatter, Histograms, and Pyramid charts are used to
 visualize
 distribution. Flow The flow is the action of moving along in a steady and
 continuous
 stream.
 Sankey diagram and Gantt are the main charts used to
 visualize
 the
 flow.  Next: Choose your chart  Previous step3. Choose Your Chart Select the right chart from the list below according to your datatype

Accessibility Features Keyboard Navigation   Screen Readers   Low Vision Features   Voice Input   Tactile Export   Sonification   Cognitive Accessibility   Internationalization  Keyboard Navigation Keyboard NavigationAn essential part of the Highcharts Accessibility module is the added
keyboard navigation support. By including the Highcharts Accessibility
module with your charts, users are able to navigate and
interact with the data points, chart menu, and other chart
controls using the keyboard only. Interactive graph  Video demo    Screen Readers Screen readersOne of the most well known assistive technologies in use by
people with disabilities, a screen reader, is a program that
attempts to convey the information on the screen using
non-visual methods, such as text-to-speech. If your charts
are using the Highcharts Accessibility module, screen reader users can
navigate, explore and interact with your charts. It will also help
your
SEO, as web crawlers can read the information provided for
screen readers. Interactive graph  Video demo     Low Vision Features Low Vision FeaturesWith the Accessibility module, Highcharts comes with
built-in support for Windows High Contrast Mode. Charts can
also be viewed in full screen for additional separation of
elements. Pattern fills are supported, as well as premade
themes with higher contrast. Custom styles are also supported for all visual
elements in the chart, and custom themes can be created. By default, series
markers have different shapes to help distinguish between data points
without the use of color. Due to the responsive nature of
Highcharts, screen zooming tools are well supported. Pattern Fills  High Contrast Themes     Voice Input Voice InputNew since Highcharts version 7.1 is support for voice input
software. Similar to keyboard navigation, this is a technology
that is beneficial to users with mobility impairments but has
potential benefits for all users. Highcharts allows users of voice input software to
interact with chart controls such as the chart menu using voice commands.
Examples of compatible software include Nuance Dragon, and
Microsoft Windows Speech Recognition.   Tactile Export Tactile ExportAs long as the exporting module is included alongside the
Accessibility module, users can download an SVG version of the
chart. This SVG can be printed and turned into a tactile graphic
using embossing printers or similar technology. Tactile graphics are often used to get
an overview of chart layouts, and can be particularly helpful to explore charts with
large datasets.  Sonification SonificationWith Highcharts, you can play back the chart as sound. This can
be highly effective for conveying trends and patterns quickly
without the need for visuals. For more information, see Sonification.   Cognitive Accessibility Cognitive AccessibilityA lot of Highcharts features are developed with the goal of
making charts easier to use and understand. This translates to
better cognitive accessibility, as well as an improved user
experience for all users. Relevant features include tooltips,
chart legends, dimming surrounding content on hover, series
labels, viewing charts in full screen, and data table support.  Internationalization InternationalizationAll Highcharts generated text content can be translated to

 updating his homepage with snow depth measurements from Vikjafjellet, the
 local mountain where his family keeps a cabin. Frustrated with the common
 flash plug-ins, and other proprietary solutions at the time, he decided to
 build a standards-based solution of his own, and share it with the world.
 It turns out he was doing more than scratching his itch. Since its launch
 in 2009, Highcharts has remained the secure choice for cutting-edge charting
 tools in a highly competitive data visualization market. Meet the team behind Highsoft.  Read more about our story   Highsoft, the company behind Highcharts, is located in Vik i Sogn, Norway.
 Vik is a beautiful small town, surrounded by spectacular mountains and
 fjords. Spending time enjoying outdoor activities in our spectacular
 natural environment has been an inspirational catalyst for many of our
 ideas and products. To find out more information about our hometown, Vik,
 please check out Torstein’s website. While the bulk of our growing team is located in Norway, the international
 nature of our business has lead us to recruit talent and forge partnerships
 outside of Vik. We also have offices in Bergen, Oslo, a dedicated support in
 Poland, and distributors across the globe. Our story in Highcharts Mission Since the inception of our company, our mission has been simple: Make it
 easy for everyone to visualize data on the web. Over the years, web
 technology (HTML & JavaScript) has become incorporated into everything
 from smart watches and thermostats, to mission-critical financial trading
 applications. Our customer base, and how they use our technology, has
 therefore also evolved. We meet these challenges with a relentless focus
 on delivering the highest quality products and support. We also strive to make it easier to consume data. Our charts not only
 intelligently adapt to any device and screen size, but have become the
 gold-standard for making charts accessible to visually impaired users.

the packed bundles are available as ESM.Note: If you code with TypeScript, please take a look at our
TypeScript article
for details about ESM bundling and type adjustments.Including a product package (ES6 module)For debugging and development purposes you can load core files directly in your
browser page and make use of tree shaking. Please note that this results in a
decreased download size but in an increased delay caused by the amount of
(small) files to load. This approach is therefore not recommended for
production.<script type="module">    import Chart from 'https://code.highcharts.com/es-modules/Core/Chart/Chart.js';    import LineSeries from 'https://code.highcharts.com/es-modules/Series/Line/LineSeries.js';    // Example to create a simple line chart in a div#container:    new Chart('container', { series: [{ data: [1, 2, 3]}] });</script>CopyCreating a custom bundle (ES6 module)The advantage of core files over packages is, that only the required features

Highcharts v6.1. Core files can also be loaded directly as ES modules since
Highcharts v11.3. The latter allows you to make use of tree shaking to only
load or bundle what is needed and reduce download and package sizes. Since v12.2
the packed bundles are available as ESM.Note: If you code with TypeScript, please take a look at our
TypeScript article
for details about ESM bundling and type adjustments.Including a product package (ES6 module)For debugging and development purposes you can load core files directly in your
browser page and make use of tree shaking. Please note that this results in a
decreased download size but in an increased delay caused by the amount of
(small) files to load. This approach is therefore not recommended for
production.<script type="module">    import Chart from 'https://code.highcharts.com/es-modules/Core/Chart/Chart.js';    import LineSeries from 'https://code.highcharts.com/es-modules/Series/Line/LineSeries.js';    // Example to create a simple line chart in a div#container:    new Chart('container', { series: [{ data: [1, 2, 3]}] });</script>CopyCreating a custom bundle (ES6 module)The advantage of core files over packages is, that only the required features
are loaded. This reduces the total download size. We can create a bundle of all
files to improve the load size and load time further. Create a NodeJS project
and install Highcharts and Webpack as NPM packages.For a line chart create the JavaScript files as shown below.// mychart.jsimport Chart from 'highcharts/es-modules/Core/Chart/Chart.js';import LineSeries from 'highcharts/es-modules/Series/Line/LineSeries.js';// Example to create a simple line chart in a div#container:const myChart = new Chart('container', {    series: [{        type: 'line',        data: [1, 2, 3]    }]});Copy// webpack.config.jsmodule.exports = {  entry: './mychart.js',  mode: 'production',  output: {    filename: 'mybundle.js',    // automatically placed in the subfolder 'dist'  },};CopyCreate the bundle by running node webpack -c webpack.config.js and load the
result in your web page.<div id="container"></div><script type="module" src="./dist/mybundle.js"></script>CopyFor a column chart or pie chart, the code of mychart.js looks similar.// mychart.jsimport Chart from 'highcharts/es-modules/Core/Chart/Chart.js';import ColumnSeries from 'highcharts/es-modules/Series/Column/ColumnSeries.js';// Example to create a simple column chart in a div#container:const myChart = new Chart('container', { series: [{ type: 'column', data: [1, 2, 3]}] });Copy// mychart.jsimport Chart from 'highcharts/es-modules/Core/Chart/Chart.js';import PieSeries from 'highcharts/es-modules/Series/Pie/PieSeries.js';// Example to create a simple pie chart in a div#container:const myChart = new Chart('container');const mySeries = new PieSeries();mySeries.init(myChart, { data: [1, 2, 3] });CopyOptional functionality via compositionsUnlike packages the core files do not provide all functionality out of the box.
You can find details about optional functionality in the source code of product
packages.Do as below to activate data labels for example.import Chart from 'highcharts/es-modules/Core/Chart/Chart.js';import LineSeries from 'highcharts/es-modules/Series/Line/LineSeries.js';import DataLabel from 'highcharts/es-modules/Core/Series/DataLabel.js';DataLabel.compose(LineSeries);Copyimport Chart from 'highcharts/es-modules/Core/Chart/Chart.js';import ColumnSeries from 'highcharts/es-modules/Series/Column/ColumnSeries.js';import ColumnDataLabel from 'highcharts/es-modules/Series/Column/ColumnDataLabel.js';ColumnDataLabel.compose(ColumnSeries);Copyimport Chart from 'highcharts/es-modules/Core/Chart/Chart.js';import PieSeries from 'highcharts/es-modules/Series/Pie/PieSeries.js';import PieDataLabel from 'highcharts/es-modules/Series/Pie/PieDataLabel.js';PieDataLabel.compose(PieSeries);CopyAdvantage of tree shakingTree shaking, by loading core files directly, helps to reduce the size of files
to download and reduces the size of your project. It is especially useful when
only a specific chart type is needed. See the following comparison for our
examples.Bundle (compiled+gzipped)Download SizeSavinghighcharts.js100,509 bytes0%LineSeries.js78,268 bytes22%ColumnSeries.js80,046 bytes20%PieSeries.js83,085 bytes17%TroubleshootingIf your project fails because of missing Highcharts code, a compose call
might be necessary after loading one of the module files. Consult the source
code of our product packages in highcharts/es-modules/masters for details.Dynamic imports from CDNHighcharts is available on our CDN as ECMAScript modules. You can import ES modules directly in modern browsers
without any bundling tools by using <script type="module"> (demo):<script type="module">    import Highcharts from 'https://code.highcharts.com/esm/highcharts.js';    import 'https://code.highcharts.com/esm/modules/accessibility.js';    Highcharts.chart('container', {        ...    });</script>CopyThe following example shows dynamic import with lazy-loading:const loadHighchartsAndCreateChart = async () => {    const { default: Highcharts } =        await import('https://code.highcharts.com/esm/highcharts.js');    await import('https://code.highcharts.com/esm/highcharts-more.js');    await import('https://code.highcharts.com/esm/modules/exporting.js');    await import('https://code.highcharts.com/esm/modules/export-data.js');    Highcharts.chart('container', { /* options */ });};CopyView it live on jsFiddle in our async loading demo;Load Highcharts as a transpiled ES6/UMD moduleSince Highcharts supports ES6 (ESM - ECMAScript modules) and UMD (AMD, CommonJS), it can be also loaded as a module with the use of transpilers. Two common transpilers are Babel and TypeScript.

This article explains how the options object works and how to use it.The options objectWhen you initialize the chart using its constructor Highcharts.Chart, the options object is the second parameter you pass:const chart1 = Highcharts.chart('container', {    chart: {        type: 'bar'    },    title: {        text: 'Fruit Consumption'    },    xAxis: {        categories: ['Apples', 'Bananas', 'Oranges']    },    yAxis: {        title: {            text: 'Fruit eaten'        }    },    series: [{        name: 'Jane',        data: [1, 0, 4]    }, {        name: 'John',        data: [5, 7, 3]    }]});CopyTo get the most out of Highcharts, it is important to understand how the options object works and how it can be altered programmatically. These are some key concepts on JavaScript objects:The Highcharts options in the examples are defined as object literals. By notating the configuration this way, we can have a clean, human readable and low space consuming config object. The following complicated code is perhaps more familiar to developers with a background from C-type languages:// Bad code:var options = new Object();options.chart = new Object();options.chart.type = 'bar';options.series = new Array();options.series[0] = new Object();options.series[0].name = 'Jane';options.series[0].data = new Array(1, 0, 4);CopyAs JavaScript object literals, we would write it like below. Note that the two options objects will produce exactly the same result.// Good code:const options = {    chart: {        type: 'bar'    },    series: [{        name: 'Jane',        data: [1, 0, 4]    }]};CopyIn the example above the options object is created by itself and can be added to the chart by passing it to the chart constructor:const chart = new Highcharts.Chart('container', options);CopyAfter an object is created using the object literal notation, we can extend its members by the dot notation. Say we have an object like defined in the "Good code" above. The code below adds another series to it. Remember options.series is an array, so it has a push method.options.series.push({    name: 'John',    data: [3, 4, 2]})CopyAnother fact that can come in handy when working on JavaScript objects, is that the dot notation and square bracket notation are equivalent, so you can access all members by their string names. Which in practice means that options.chart.type is always the same as: options['chart']['type']Global OptionsIf you want to apply a set of options to all charts on the same page, use Highcharts.setOptions like shown below. Highcharts.setOptions({    chart: {        backgroundColor: {            linearGradient: [0, 0, 500, 500],            stops: [                [0, 'rgb(255, 255, 255)'],                [1, 'rgb(240, 240, 255)']            ]        },        borderWidth: 2,        plotBackgroundColor: 'rgba(255, 255, 255, .9)',        plotShadow: true,        plotBorderWidth: 1    }});const chart1 = Highcharts.chart('container', {    xAxis: {        type: 'datetime'    },    series: [{        data: [29.9, 71.5, 106.4, 129.2, 144.0, 176.0, 135.6, 148.5, 216.4, 194.1, 95.6, 54.4],        pointStart: Date.UTC(2010, 0, 1),        pointInterval: 3600 * 1000 // one hour    }]});const chart2 = Highcharts.chart('container2', {    chart: {        type: 'column'    },    xAxis: {        type: 'datetime'    },    series: [{        data: [29.9, 71.5, 106.4, 129.2, 144.0, 176.0, 135.6, 148.5, 216.4, 194.1, 95.6, 54.4],        pointStart: Date.UTC(2010, 0, 1),        pointInterval: 3600 * 1000 // one hour    }]});CopyNote: The themes supplied with Highcharts download use this function.

Since not all browsers are able to convert the chart to an image format, this operation is by default done on our web service, https://export.highcharts.com. The generated SVG is sent from your browser to the export server, and an image is sent back. If you're concerned about your data content being passed over the internet, you should consider our alternative solutions. The simplest alternative is to use our module for client-side export. Check out the features and compatibility table if it meets your requirements. If you have access to a node server, you can also set up your own export server. Certain features, including client side exporting, may require third-party dependencies. Some of these are loaded on demand from our servers, but in these cases the loading location is configurable. Details on all external dependencies, including licensing and security details, can be found in the optional dependencies documentation article.Stock Tools icons. By default the icons are loaded dynamically from https://code.highcharts.com. To change where icons should be loaded from see the iconsURL option.Can I use Highcharts with a ... server?Highcharts runs entirely on the client, and works with any web server that can deliver HTML and JavaScript content. Whether your server is PHP, Perl, ASP, ASP.NET, Node.js or whatever, Highcharts is completely ignorant of it. The HTML/JavaScript files may also be loaded from the file system, which is the case in app platforms where Highcharts is loaded in a web component inside the app.The best practice in integrating Highcharts may differ from system to system. You should follow the common practice for handing JavaScript on your specific system. Some prefer to serve a clean JSON or JavaScript file with the Highcharts setup, others to write the JavaScript setup directly to the web page. Data can be loaded in form of JSON or CSV files (see Working with data in the left menu), or printed inline in the chart setup. When working with a database powered backend, it may be cleaner to have your server system serve JSON or CSV files.For a live connection to the server, you may set up the web page to load new data over XHR or set up direct communications using WebSockets. With the new data arriving in the browser, the chart can be kept updated through various dynamic endpoints like Series.addPoint(), Point.update(), Chart.addSeries(), Chart.update() etc.Before you start to set up a complex backend, you may want to check out highcharts.com/download to see if there is a wrapper for your specific system.Can I use features from Highcharts Stock in Highcharts?Yes, most Highcharts Stock features can be applied to standard charts. From a licensing point of view, using features of the Stock package obviously requires a Highcharts Stock license.Technically Highcharts Stock is implemented as a set of plugins for Highcharts. The entire code base for Highcharts is included in the Stock package, and you can invoke a chart using Highcharts.Chart and enable certain features that are normally associated with a stock chart.Examples:Using flags in HighchartsEnabling a scrollbar in HighchartsGap size in HighchartsCan I add a data table to the exported chart?If you don't care about the export, a data table is simply added by the export-data module and a simple option, exporting.showTable. However this table doesn't support exporting to SVG or other image formats, but with a little programming on top of the Highcharts data and drawing API you can draw a table. See our jsFiddle demo for source code and live example.How can I get the best performance out of Highcharts?When working with series with a high number of data points, there are a few things to consider.First of all, consider using the Boost module.Otherwise, for line plots, it is recommended that you disable point markers, as these will add a performance overhead. See https://highcharts.com/demo/line-time-series.Disabling shadows increases performance, as three shadow elements are created for each shape that includes a shadow.If you have a Stock licence, consider using the Data Grouping module. This module packs multiple consecutive values into the same point, and results in considerably fewer points to render. This greatly
reduces the initial loading time. The following chart compares the loading times of the same data set with and without data grouping.Can I export multiple charts to the same image or PDF?Currently this isn't implemented in the core, but there are a couple of paths you can go to achieve this. Use our hack for exporting multiple charts. Basically, this code gets the SVG of all charts, modifies it and applies it to one single SVG file that is sent to the server for image conversion. We also support using our client side exporting module, if sending data to our server is a concern. See this demo for an example of this approach.Create a HTML file on your server that contains all your desired charts, and do a pure server side conversion of this. See Can I generate charts on the server without using a browser?My non-English characters don't display right in my chartsIf you're using German umlauts, Scandinavian vowels or non-European alphabets, you need to use UTF-8 encoding for your files. There are two ways of doing this.Make sure your HTML page where your charts are defined, is UTF-8. The file itself and if applicable its database content must be encoded as UTF-8. Additionally, either the content-type HTTP header or the corresponding meta tag must reflect this:<meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />CopyIf you don't have access to change your whole HTML file, you can define your charts in a separate JS file that has UTF-8 encoding. <script src="charts.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>CopyCan I generate charts on the server without using a browser?Yes. See our article, Render charts on the server.How do I define irregular time data?To add data points with irregular intervals, instead of defining pointStart and pointInterval for the series, define an X value (date) for each point. See demo of irregular time.If you want the line to be broken for missing dates, insert null values instead.How do I add data from a MySQL database?See Preprocessing data from a database.Your map of my country does not include a disputed areaWe do our best not to take sides in border conflicts, however we realize the need for maps including disputed areas. To solve this, we try to keep our default maps conforming to neutral de facto borders or conventions, while providing alternative maps that include disputed areas.

The HTML/JavaScript files may also be loaded from the file system, which is the case in app platforms where Highcharts is loaded in a web component inside the app.The best practice in integrating Highcharts may differ from system to system. You should follow the common practice for handing JavaScript on your specific system. Some prefer to serve a clean JSON or JavaScript file with the Highcharts setup, others to write the JavaScript setup directly to the web page. Data can be loaded in form of JSON or CSV files (see Working with data in the left menu), or printed inline in the chart setup. When working with a database powered backend, it may be cleaner to have your server system serve JSON or CSV files.For a live connection to the server, you may set up the web page to load new data over XHR or set up direct communications using WebSockets. With the new data arriving in the browser, the chart can be kept updated through various dynamic endpoints like Series.addPoint(), Point.update(), Chart.addSeries(), Chart.update() etc.Before you start to set up a complex backend, you may want to check out highcharts.com/download to see if there is a wrapper for your specific system.Can I use features from Highcharts Stock in Highcharts?Yes, most Highcharts Stock features can be applied to standard charts. From a licensing point of view, using features of the Stock package obviously requires a Highcharts Stock license.Technically Highcharts Stock is implemented as a set of plugins for Highcharts. The entire code base for Highcharts is included in the Stock package, and you can invoke a chart using Highcharts.Chart and enable certain features that are normally associated with a stock chart.Examples:Using flags in HighchartsEnabling a scrollbar in HighchartsGap size in HighchartsCan I add a data table to the exported chart?If you don't care about the export, a data table is simply added by the export-data module and a simple option, exporting.showTable. However this table doesn't support exporting to SVG or other image formats, but with a little programming on top of the Highcharts data and drawing API you can draw a table. See our jsFiddle demo for source code and live example.How can I get the best performance out of Highcharts?When working with series with a high number of data points, there are a few things to consider.First of all, consider using the Boost module.Otherwise, for line plots, it is recommended that you disable point markers, as these will add a performance overhead. See https://highcharts.com/demo/line-time-series.Disabling shadows increases performance, as three shadow elements are created for each shape that includes a shadow.If you have a Stock licence, consider using the Data Grouping module. This module packs multiple consecutive values into the same point, and results in considerably fewer points to render. This greatly
reduces the initial loading time. The following chart compares the loading times of the same data set with and without data grouping.Can I export multiple charts to the same image or PDF?Currently this isn't implemented in the core, but there are a couple of paths you can go to achieve this. Use our hack for exporting multiple charts. Basically, this code gets the SVG of all charts, modifies it and applies it to one single SVG file that is sent to the server for image conversion. We also support using our client side exporting module, if sending data to our server is a concern. See this demo for an example of this approach.Create a HTML file on your server that contains all your desired charts, and do a pure server side conversion of this. See Can I generate charts on the server without using a browser?My non-English characters don't display right in my chartsIf you're using German umlauts, Scandinavian vowels or non-European alphabets, you need to use UTF-8 encoding for your files. There are two ways of doing this.Make sure your HTML page where your charts are defined, is UTF-8. The file itself and if applicable its database content must be encoded as UTF-8. Additionally, either the content-type HTTP header or the corresponding meta tag must reflect this:<meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />CopyIf you don't have access to change your whole HTML file, you can define your charts in a separate JS file that has UTF-8 encoding. <script src="charts.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>CopyCan I generate charts on the server without using a browser?Yes. See our article, Render charts on the server.How do I define irregular time data?To add data points with irregular intervals, instead of defining pointStart and pointInterval for the series, define an X value (date) for each point. See demo of irregular time.If you want the line to be broken for missing dates, insert null values instead.How do I add data from a MySQL database?See Preprocessing data from a database.Your map of my country does not include a disputed areaWe do our best not to take sides in border conflicts, however we realize the need for maps including disputed areas.

Since not all browsers are able to convert the chart to an image format, this operation is by default done on our web service, https://export.highcharts.com. The generated SVG is sent from your browser to the export server, and an image is sent back. If you're concerned about your data content being passed over the internet, you should consider our alternative solutions. The simplest alternative is to use our module for client-side export. Check out the features and compatibility table if it meets your requirements. If you have access to a node server, you can also set up your own export server. Certain features, including client side exporting, may require third-party dependencies. Some of these are loaded on demand from our servers, but in these cases the loading location is configurable. Details on all external dependencies, including licensing and security details, can be found in the optional dependencies documentation article.Stock Tools icons. By default the icons are loaded dynamically from https://code.highcharts.com.

A benefit of using a custom file can be optimization of browser load speed due
to lower file size and less files to request.Follow the steps below to get started.Install HighchartsGo to the highcharts/highcharts
repository and click on "Code" and select "Download ZIP". Once the zip file is
downloaded, unpack it to a desired location.The following steps require Node.js, which you can download and install from the
Node.js website. Highcharts supports the LTS variant.When Node.js is installed, open you command line, shell, or terminal, and go to
the unpacked folder highcharts-master. There you have to run npm install to
install the required dependencies for building custom Highcharts files.Create a custom master fileIn your editor, go to the unpacked folder highcharts-master/ts/masters/ and
create a new file, named for example custom.src.ts. In this example we want a
basic line chart. To achieve this we will need a setup that lists all the needed
ES modules like this:/** * @license Highcharts JS [email protected]@ (@product.date@) * @module highcharts/highcharts * * (c) 2009-2024 Highcharts AS * * License: www.highcharts.com/license */'use strict';import Highcharts from '../Core/Globals.js';import SVGRenderer from '../Core/Renderer/SVG/SVGRenderer.js';import Chart from '../Core/Chart/Chart.js';import LineSeries from '../Series/Line/LineSeries.js';const exports: Record<string, any> = Highcharts;exports.Renderer = SVGRenderer;exports.SVGRenderer = SVGRenderer;exports.Chart = Chart;exports.chart = Chart.chart;exports.LineSeries = LineSeries;export default Highcharts;CopyModify the setup according to your needs, then proceed with the next step.
Please note that the order of the imported ES modules sometimes have to match
the dependencies of each file. Optional additions therefore should come last.

Thanks to this change everyone can soon also use the full potential of ESM (ES Module) packages.
The new UMD is with some setups compatible to the previous UMD, while it also brings some changes for other setups.
This document lays out the changes of Highcharts v12 packages.1. No module factoryThe new UMD does not come with a factory for Highcharts modules anymore.
Instead of calling each factory with the Highcharts namespace, all modules will recognize automatically the shared namespace.
This means less code to load Highcharts modules.Before v12:import Highcharts from 'highcharts';import HighchartsExport from 'highcharts/modules/exporting';HighchartsExport(Highcharts);CopyWith v12:import Highcharts from 'highcharts';import 'highcharts/modules/exporting';CopySupport both variants:import Highcharts from 'highcharts';import HighchartsExport from 'highcharts/modules/exporting';typeof HighchartsExport === 'function' && HighchartsExport(Highcharts);Copy2.

with a cartesian coordinate system.
Here is a quick overview of the axis elements:Axis labels, tickmarks and gridlinesThe axis labels, tickmarks and gridlines are closely linked and all scale together. Their positioning is calculated to best fit the data present in a chart. TicksTick marks are the lines placed along an axis to show the units of measurement. The spacing between ticks are mainly decided by the tickInterval and tickPixelInterval options. Labels and grid lines are laid out on the same positions as the tick marks. The tickInterval option decides the interval of the tick marks in axis units. The tick interval defaults to null, which means it is computed to approximately follow the tickPixelInterval on linear and datetime axes.On categorized axes, a null tickInterval will default to 1, one category.Note that datetime axes are based on milliseconds, so for example an interval of one day is expressed as 24 * 3600 * 1000. On logarithmic axes, the tickInterval is based on powers, so a tickInterval of 1 means one tick on each of 0.1, 1, 10, 100 etc. A tickInterval of 2 means a tick of 0.1, 10, 1000 etc. A tickInterval of 0.2 puts a tick on 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 20, 40 etc.The tickPixelInterval option sets an approximate pixel interval of the tick marks based on a pixel value (if tickInterval is nullish). This makes it work well with responsive layouts, ensuring a reasonable distance between ticks regardless of the chart size and axis length. It doesn't apply to categorized axis. Defaults to 72 for the y-axis and 100 for the x-axis.Minor ticksIf the minorTickInterval option is set, minor ticks are laid out between the major ones. This includes minor tick marks, and minor grid lines, which have their own options for look and feel, but excludes labels. LabelsThe axis labels can be found along the axis showing the value of the data it corresponds to. Labels can also be customized using a format string or a formatter function:yAxis: {    labels: {        format: '{value}%', // provides the same result as:        formatter: function() {            return this.value + ' %';        }    },},CopyThe above example takes the value of the y-axis label and adds a % symbol at the end of it.Grid linesGrid lines are collections of horizontal (and/or vertical) lines that divide a chart into a grid, making it easier to read values of the chart. To enable or disable gridlines for either the x or y-axis, set the gridLineWidth of the respective axis:xAxis: {    gridLineWidth: 1},yAxis: {    gridLineWidth: 1}CopyGrid lines for the y-axis are enabled by default (gridLineWidth: 1), and disabled by default for the x-axis  (gridLineWidth: 0).Other options for grid lines can be found in the API reference for the x and y-axis.Minor grid lines are intermediary lines that can be enabled by setting the minorTickInterval option.Multiple axesIt is possible to have multiple axes and linking them with different data series. To do this several axes needs to be created, like this:yAxis: [{ //--- Primary yAxis    title: {        text: 'Temperature'    }}, { //--- Secondary yAxis    title: {        text: 'Rainfall'    },    opposite: true}],series: [{    yAxis: 0,    data: [        49.9, 71.5, 106.4, 129.2, 144.0, 176.0, 135.6, 148.5, 216.4, 194.1,        95.6, 54.4    ]},{    yAxis: 1,    data: [        7.0, 6.9, 9.5, 14.5, 18.2, 21.5, 25.2, 26.5, 23.3, 18.3, 13.9, 9.6    ]}]CopyNote that several axes are created using a list, so the first yAxis starts with index 0. And the opposite: true option puts the axis on the right side of the chart.Align ticksWhen using multiple axes, it is usually desirable to align the ticks, to avoid multiple sets of grid lines to mess up the chart. The chart.alignTicks option is true by default. The downside of alignment is that each axis is pre-determined to have the same tick amount as the others, so the fitting of ticks may not be optimal. An alternative is to turn off alignTicks and set gridLineWidth to 0.Align thresholdsSince v10, it is possible to align the thresholds of multiple axes through the chart.alignThresholds option. This is similar to alignTicks but goes one step further by also ensuring zero-levels or other kinds of thresholds are aligned.Axis title The axis title, showing next to the axis line. This title by default for the y-axis and hidden by default for the x-axis. See xAxis.title for the full set of options.Axis typesAn axis can be either, linear, logarithmic, datetime or categories. The axis type is set like this:// The types are 'linear', 'logarithmic' and 'datetime'yAxis: {    type: 'linear',}// Categories are set by using an arrayxAxis: {    categories: ['Apples', 'Bananas', 'Oranges']}CopyLinearThe numbers along the axis are of linear scale. This is the default axis type. If only y-values are present in a dataseries the x-axis is labeled from 0 to the number of y-values (shows the array index of the y-values):var chart = new Highcharts.Chart({        chart: {            renderTo: 'container',            type: 'column'        },        title: {            text: 'Fruit Consumption'        },        xAxis: {            title: {                text: 'Fruit Number'            },            tickInterval: 1        },        yAxis: {            title: {                text: 'Fruit eaten'            },            tickInterval: 1        },        series: [{            name: 'Jane',            data: [1, 0, 4]        }, {            name: 'John',            data: [5, 7, 3]        }]    }});CopyLogarithmicOn a logarithmic axis the numbers along the axis increase logarithmically and the axis adjusts itself to the data series present in the chart.Note that on logarithmic axes, the tickInterval option is based on powers, so a tickInterval of 1 means one tick on each of 0.1, 1, 10, 100 etc. A tickInterval of 2 means a tick of 0.1, 10, 1000 etc. A tickInterval of 0.2 puts a tick on 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 20, 40 etc.Another thing to note is that a logarithmic axis can never become negative, as each full axis unit is one tenth of the previous. As a consequence, Highcharts will remove 0 or negative points associated to the axis, and if you try to set the axis.min option to 0 or negative, it will fail with an error.A trick to plot zero and negative values on a logarithmic axis in HighchartsLet's begin by delving into the core concept of logarithms. When we have an equation like 10 raised to the power of L equals Z, we say that L is the logarithm with a base of 10 for Z. If L is a negative number, this implies that Z is a positive fraction smaller than 1.0. In the case where L equals zero, Z is precisely 1.0. On the other hand, if L is greater than 0, then Z exceeds 1.0. It's essential to emphasize that no matter the value of L, it's impossible for Z to be zero or negative. Logarithms do not have defined values for such cases, they exclusively operate on positive numbers.If you would like to show zero and negative values on a logarithmic axis in Highcharts, the only viable approach is to employ a custom plugin. This plugin allows for the emulation of negative values on a logarithmic axis. It's important to bear in mind that the resulting scale is not mathematically precise since a true logarithmic axis never touches or crosses zero. The custom plugin can be found in this demo.DatetimeA datetime axis prints labels of round date values in appropriate intervals. Internally, a datetime axis is a linear numeric axis based on milliseconds since midnight Jan 1, 1970, as specified by the JavaScript Date object. Depending on the scale the datetime label will either be represented as time or a date.On datetime axes, all time settings may be given either as milliseconds, date strings (since v12), or Date objects. This includes options like min and max, arguments to Axis.setExtremes, as well as related options like point.x and series.pointStart. Date strings are parsed and assigned the current timezone as given in the chart-level time.timezone option, or to the timezone indicated in the time string itself.In Highcharts Stock the x-axis is always a datetime axis.CategoriesIf categories are present, the names of the categories are used instead of numbers or dates on the axis. See xAxis.categories.What axis type should I use?Many of the examples on the Highcharts demo page come with an xAxis with categories. However, it is important to understand when to use categories and when you are better off with a linear or datetime xAxis.Categories are groups of items, like for example "Apples", "Pears" and "Oranges", or "Red", "Green", "Blue", "Yellow". These categories have that in common that there are no intermediate values. There's no sliding transition between apples and pears. Also, if you leave one category out, the user isn't able to understand what is left out. Say if you print every second color of "Red", "Green", "Blue" or "Yellow", the user won't know what colors are missing. Therefore, Highcharts doesn't have automatic methods to hide categories if they become to dense on the axis. If you have problems with overlapping axis labels, try either the xAxis.labels.staggerLines option, or give the labels a rotation. If you find that you can skip category labels by the xAxis.labels.step option, chances are that you are better off using a linear or datetime axis.An xAxis of the linear or datetime type has the advantage that Highcharts is able to determine how close the data labels should be because it knows how to interpolate. The labels will by default be placed with approximately 100px between them, which can be changed in the tickPixelInterval option. If you have predictable categories like "Item1", "Item2", "Item3" or "2012-01-01", "2012-01-02", "2012-01-03" etc., linear or datetime axis types combined with an xAxis.labels.formatter would probably be a better choice.Dynamically updating axesAxes can be updated with new information after render time. For more information about this look in the API.\n\nAxesThe x-axis and y-axis are shown by default in all charts containing data series

If only y-values are present in a dataseries the x-axis is labeled from 0 to the number of y-values (shows the array index of the y-values):var chart = new Highcharts.Chart({        chart: {            renderTo: 'container',            type: 'column'        },        title: {            text: 'Fruit Consumption'        },        xAxis: {            title: {                text: 'Fruit Number'            },            tickInterval: 1        },        yAxis: {            title: {                text: 'Fruit eaten'            },            tickInterval: 1        },        series: [{            name: 'Jane',            data: [1, 0, 4]        }, {            name: 'John',            data: [5, 7, 3]        }]    }});CopyLogarithmicOn a logarithmic axis the numbers along the axis increase logarithmically and the axis adjusts itself to the data series present in the chart.Note that on logarithmic axes, the tickInterval option is based on powers, so a tickInterval of 1 means one tick on each of 0.1, 1, 10, 100 etc. A tickInterval of 2 means a tick of 0.1, 10, 1000 etc. A tickInterval of 0.2 puts a tick on 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 20, 40 etc.Another thing to note is that a logarithmic axis can never become negative, as each full axis unit is one tenth of the previous. As a consequence, Highcharts will remove 0 or negative points associated to the axis, and if you try to set the axis.min option to 0 or negative, it will fail with an error.A trick to plot zero and negative values on a logarithmic axis in HighchartsLet's begin by delving into the core concept of logarithms. When we have an equation like 10 raised to the power of L equals Z, we say that L is the logarithm with a base of 10 for Z. If L is a negative number, this implies that Z is a positive fraction smaller than 1.0. In the case where L equals zero, Z is precisely 1.0. On the other hand, if L is greater than 0, then Z exceeds 1.0. It's essential to emphasize that no matter the value of L, it's impossible for Z to be zero or negative. Logarithms do not have defined values for such cases, they exclusively operate on positive numbers.If you would like to show zero and negative values on a logarithmic axis in Highcharts, the only viable approach is to employ a custom plugin. This plugin allows for the emulation of negative values on a logarithmic axis. It's important to bear in mind that the resulting scale is not mathematically precise since a true logarithmic axis never touches or crosses zero. The custom plugin can be found in this demo.DatetimeA datetime axis prints labels of round date values in appropriate intervals. Internally, a datetime axis is a linear numeric axis based on milliseconds since midnight Jan 1, 1970, as specified by the JavaScript Date object. Depending on the scale the datetime label will either be represented as time or a date.On datetime axes, all time settings may be given either as milliseconds, date strings (since v12), or Date objects. This includes options like min and max, arguments to Axis.setExtremes, as well as related options like point.x and series.pointStart. Date strings are parsed and assigned the current timezone as given in the chart-level time.timezone option, or to the timezone indicated in the time string itself.In Highcharts Stock the x-axis is always a datetime axis.CategoriesIf categories are present, the names of the categories are used instead of numbers or dates on the axis. See xAxis.categories.What axis type should I use?Many of the examples on the Highcharts demo page come with an xAxis with categories. However, it is important to understand when to use categories and when you are better off with a linear or datetime xAxis.Categories are groups of items, like for example "Apples", "Pears" and "Oranges", or "Red", "Green", "Blue", "Yellow". These categories have that in common that there are no intermediate values. There's no sliding transition between apples and pears. Also, if you leave one category out, the user isn't able to understand what is left out. Say if you print every second color of "Red", "Green", "Blue" or "Yellow", the user won't know what colors are missing. Therefore, Highcharts doesn't have automatic methods to hide categories if they become to dense on the axis. If you have problems with overlapping axis labels, try either the xAxis.labels.staggerLines option, or give the labels a rotation. If you find that you can skip category labels by the xAxis.labels.step option, chances are that you are better off using a linear or datetime axis.An xAxis of the linear or datetime type has the advantage that Highcharts is able to determine how close the data labels should be because it knows how to interpolate. The labels will by default be placed with approximately 100px between them, which can be changed in the tickPixelInterval option. If you have predictable categories like "Item1", "Item2", "Item3" or "2012-01-01", "2012-01-02", "2012-01-03" etc., linear or datetime axis types combined with an xAxis.labels.formatter would probably be a better choice.Dynamically updating axesAxes can be updated with new information after render time. For more information about this look in the API.Edit this pagePrevious« Title and subtitle NextBubble legend  »Axis labels, tickmarks and gridlinesTicksMinor ticksLabelsGrid linesMultiple axesAlign ticksAlign thresholdsAxis title Axis typesLinearLogarithmicDatetimeCategoriesWhat axis type should I use?Dynamically updating axes\n\nAxesThe x-axis and y-axis are shown by default in all charts containing data series
with a cartesian coordinate system.
Here is a quick overview of the axis elements:Axis labels, tickmarks and gridlinesThe axis labels, tickmarks and gridlines are closely linked and all scale together. Their positioning is calculated to best fit the data present in a chart. TicksTick marks are the lines placed along an axis to show the units of measurement. The spacing between ticks are mainly decided by the tickInterval and tickPixelInterval options. Labels and grid lines are laid out on the same positions as the tick marks. The tickInterval option decides the interval of the tick marks in axis units. The tick interval defaults to null, which means it is computed to approximately follow the tickPixelInterval on linear and datetime axes.On categorized axes, a null tickInterval will default to 1, one category.Note that datetime axes are based on milliseconds, so for example an interval of one day is expressed as 24 * 3600 * 1000. On logarithmic axes, the tickInterval is based on powers, so a tickInterval of 1 means one tick on each of 0.1, 1, 10, 100 etc. A tickInterval of 2 means a tick of 0.1, 10, 1000 etc. A tickInterval of 0.2 puts a tick on 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 20, 40 etc.The tickPixelInterval option sets an approximate pixel interval of the tick marks based on a pixel value (if tickInterval is nullish). This makes it work well with responsive layouts, ensuring a reasonable distance between ticks regardless of the chart size and axis length. It doesn't apply to categorized axis. Defaults to 72 for the y-axis and 100 for the x-axis.Minor ticksIf the minorTickInterval option is set, minor ticks are laid out between the major ones. This includes minor tick marks, and minor grid lines, which have their own options for look and feel, but excludes labels. LabelsThe axis labels can be found along the axis showing the value of the data it corresponds to. Labels can also be customized using a format string or a formatter function:yAxis: {    labels: {        format: '{value}%', // provides the same result as:        formatter: function() {            return this.value + ' %';        }    },},CopyThe above example takes the value of the y-axis label and adds a % symbol at the end of it.Grid linesGrid lines are collections of horizontal (and/or vertical) lines that divide a chart into a grid, making it easier to read values of the chart. To enable or disable gridlines for either the x or y-axis, set the gridLineWidth of the respective axis:xAxis: {    gridLineWidth: 1},yAxis: {    gridLineWidth: 1}CopyGrid lines for the y-axis are enabled by default (gridLineWidth: 1), and disabled by default for the x-axis  (gridLineWidth: 0).Other options for grid lines can be found in the API reference for the x and y-axis.Minor grid lines are intermediary lines that can be enabled by setting the minorTickInterval option.Multiple axesIt is possible to have multiple axes and linking them with different data series. To do this several axes needs to be created, like this:yAxis: [{ //--- Primary yAxis    title: {        text: 'Temperature'    }}, { //--- Secondary yAxis    title: {        text: 'Rainfall'    },    opposite: true}],series: [{    yAxis: 0,    data: [        49.9, 71.5, 106.4, 129.2, 144.0, 176.0, 135.6, 148.5, 216.4, 194.1,        95.6, 54.4    ]},{    yAxis: 1,    data: [        7.0, 6.9, 9.5, 14.5, 18.2, 21.5, 25.2, 26.5, 23.3, 18.3, 13.9, 9.6    ]}]CopyNote that several axes are created using a list, so the first yAxis starts with index 0. And the opposite: true option puts the axis on the right side of the chart.Align ticksWhen using multiple axes, it is usually desirable to align the ticks, to avoid multiple sets of grid lines to mess up the chart. The chart.alignTicks option is true by default. The downside of alignment is that each axis is pre-determined to have the same tick amount as the others, so the fitting of ticks may not be optimal. An alternative is to turn off alignTicks and set gridLineWidth to 0.Align thresholdsSince v10, it is possible to align the thresholds of multiple axes through the chart.alignThresholds option. This is similar to alignTicks but goes one step further by also ensuring zero-levels or other kinds of thresholds are aligned.Axis title The axis title, showing next to the axis line. This title by default for the y-axis and hidden by default for the x-axis. See xAxis.title for the full set of options.Axis typesAn axis can be either, linear, logarithmic, datetime or categories.

In this case, the numerical values will be interpreted as y values and the x values will be automatically calculated, either starting at 0 and incrementing by 1, or from the pointStart and pointInterval options. If the axis has categories, these will be used. Example:data: [0, 5, 3, 5]CopyOnline exampleA list of arrays with two or more values. In this case, the first value is the x value and the second is the y value. If the first value is a date string and the x-axis is of type datetime, the string is parsed into a date. Otherwise if the first value is a string, it is applied as the name of the point, and the x value is incremented following the above rules. Some series, like arearange, accept more than two values. See API documentation for each series type. Example:data: [[5, 2], [6, 3], [8, 2]]CopyOnline exampleA list of objects with named values. In this case the objects are point configuration objects as seen under options.point. The full list of available properties can be seen from the API, for example for line series. Note that for this option to work in Highcharts Stock, the total number of points must not exceed the turboThreshold, or the turboThreshold setting must be increased. Example:data: [{    name: 'Point 1',    color: '#00FF00',    y: 0}, {    name: 'Point 2',    color: '#FF00FF',    y: 5}]CopyOnline examplePoint and markerFor cartesian charts, a point represents a (x, y) pair on the chart. Points can be given separate options inside the series data. For other chart types, the point represents other values than (x, y). For instance, in a range chart, the point represents (x, low, high). In an OHLC chart, the point represents (x, open, high, low, close). In a pie chart or gauge, the point represents a single value.The point option can be applied to all charts. Here is an example showing how to edit the color of a specific point:series: [{    data: [29.9, 71.5, 106.4, 129.2, 144.0, 176.0, 135.6, 148.5,            { y: 216.4, color: '#BF0B23'}, 194.1, 95.6, 54.4]}]CopyLine, spline, area and areaspline charts have the option to display point markers, these are slightly different from the point option because they enable altering the style and shape of the point marker.Here is an example showing how to alter the color and size of a marker on a specific point.series: [{    data: [29.9, 71.5, 106.4, 129.2, 144.0, 176.0, 135.6, 148.5,    {y: 216.4, marker: { fillColor: '#BF0B23', radius: 10 } }, 194.1, 95.6, 54.4]}]CopySeries optionsThe series options can be defined in two places within the Highcharts options structure.General options that apply to multiple series are defined in the plotOptions. To set general options for all series in the chart, use plotOptions.series. To set general options for a specific chart type, each chart type has its own collection of plotOptions.Specific options for each series are defined in the series options structure. All options that are listed for the plotOptions structure, can also be set in the specific series definition. Some options, like data, id or name, only make sense for specific series.Here is an overview over the most common options that can be applied to a data series:AnimationAllows disabling or altering the characteristics of the initial animation of a series. Animation is enabled by default.ColorAllows changing the color of a series.Point selectionAllows the selection and highlighting of a single point. Can be used to remove, edit or display information about a point.Try it hereCode to enable point selection:plotOptions: {    series: {        allowPointSelect: true    }}CopyCode to get the selected points:var selectedPoints = chart.getSelectedPoints();CopyLine widthAllows altering the width of a line.Try it hereCode to alter line width:series: [{    data: [216.4, 194.1, 95.6],    lineWidth: 5}],CopyStackingStacking allows series to be placed on top of each other without overlapping. See Stacking charts for more information.CursorAllows the cursor to change appearance to indicate that points and series are clickable.Data labelsAllows data labels to be displayed for each point of data in a series on the chart.Try it hereCode example showing how to enable datalabels:plotOptions: {    line: {        dataLabels: {            enabled: true        }    }},CopyNote: You may wish to disable mouse tracking, which highlights the series and points the mouse hovers over (tooltips will not show if mouse tracking is disabled).The text displayed on datalabels may also be customized by using the formatter option. See API reference for more options.Dash styleAllows to use dashed lines instead of solid, there are several different dash options available.Try it hereCode to set dashed lines for an individual series (the dashStyle can also be set in plotOptions):series: [{    data: [1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 4, 6, 2, 3, 5, 6],    dashStyle: 'longdash'}]CopyZonesIn some cases, you would want to display certain sections of the graph different. A common example is to use different colors when data falls in a certain range.  This effect can be achieved by using zones.  By default zoning is done on the yAxis, but this can be easily changed by setting the zoneAxis variable on the series.  For the zoning itself, you have to define an array called zones where each entry corresponds to a zone, delimited by a parameter value, which is the point up to which the zones goes. The settings that can be overwritten for each zone are color, fillColor and dashStyle.Code used for the zoning:zones: [{    value: 0,    color: '#f7a35c'}, {    value: 10,    color: '#7cb5ec'}, {    color: '#90ed7d'}]CopyAnother common use of this is to style future, estimated data points differently.Code used for the zoning:zoneAxis: 'x',zones: [{    value: 8}, {    dashStyle: 'dot'}]CopySee the API for more information.\n\nSeriesWhat is a series?A series is a set of data, for example a line graph or one set of columns. All data plotted on a chart comes from the series object. The series object has the structure:series: [{    name: '',    data: []}]CopyNote: The series object is an array, meaning it can contain several series.The name attribute gives the series a name, which shows up when hovering over the series in a chart and in the legend.The data in a seriesThe actual data is represented as an array, by the data attribute, and can be presented in three ways:A list of numerical values. In this case, the numerical values will be interpreted as y values and the x values will be automatically calculated, either starting at 0 and incrementing by 1, or from the pointStart and pointInterval options. If the axis has categories, these will be used. Example:data: [0, 5, 3, 5]CopyOnline exampleA list of arrays with two or more values. In this case, the first value is the x value and the second is the y value. If the first value is a date string and the x-axis is of type datetime, the string is parsed into a date. Otherwise if the first value is a string, it is applied as the name of the point, and the x value is incremented following the above rules. Some series, like arearange, accept more than two values. See API documentation for each series type. Example:data: [[5, 2], [6, 3], [8, 2]]CopyOnline exampleA list of objects with named values. In this case the objects are point configuration objects as seen under options.point. The full list of available properties can be seen from the API, for example for line series. Note that for this option to work in Highcharts Stock, the total number of points must not exceed the turboThreshold, or the turboThreshold setting must be increased. Example:data: [{    name: 'Point 1',    color: '#00FF00',    y: 0}, {    name: 'Point 2',    color: '#FF00FF',    y: 5}]CopyOnline examplePoint and markerFor cartesian charts, a point represents a (x, y) pair on the chart. Points can be given separate options inside the series data. For other chart types, the point represents other values than (x, y). For instance, in a range chart, the point represents (x, low, high).

When a plot band/line is used on both the x- and y-axis, the plot band/line on the y-axis will be shown in front, as seen in the example below. Plot bands can be created either on the x-axis or the y-axis. It can also be created on both axes:xAxis: {  ...,  plotBands: [{    color: 'orange', // Color value    from: 3, // Start of the plot band    to: 4 // End of the plot band  }],  plotLines: [{    color: 'red', // Color value    dashStyle: 'longdashdot', // Style of the plot line.

This is a text which will be shown on top of the band or line.To create labels for plot bands or lines you can add the object "label":plotBands: {  ...,  label: {     text: 'I am a label', // Content of the label.     align: 'left', // Positioning of the label. Default to center.    x: +10 // Amount of pixels the label will be repositioned according to the alignment.   }}CopyEvents"events" are an object which can be created inside a plot band or plot line object. This object defines mouse events according to the band or line. Values that are supported are click, mouseover, mouseout and mousemove.plotBands: {  ...,  events: {    click: function () {      // Action performed when event occurs    },    mouseover: function () {      // Action performed when event occurs    },    mouseout: function () {      // Action performed when event occurs    },    mousemove: function () {      // Action performed when event occurs    }  }}CopyExample of how events can be used.Dynamically updateAfter render time a chart can be updated with new plot bands or lines, or if you want some can be removed. This is done by using the functions addPlotBand(), addPlotLine(), removePlotBand() or removePlotLine().

While formatter callbacks have greater flexibility, format strings are typically more compact, and they are JSON compatible.HTML in HighchartsTexts and labels in Highcharts are given in HTML, but as the HTML is parsed and rendered in SVG, only a subset is supported. The following tags are supported: <a>, <b>, <strong>, <i>, <em>, <br/>, <span>. Spans can be styled with a style attribute, but only text-related CSS that is shared with SVG is handled.Most places where text is handled in Highcharts, it is also followed by an
option called useHTML. When this is true, the text is laid out as HTML on top
of the chart. This allows for full HTML support and can be a good idea if you
want to add images in your labels, tables in your tooltip etc.Prior to Highcharts v12.2, the downsides are:It will always be laid out on top of all other SVG content. Specifically the
tooltip may be rendered below the useHTML label, unless
tooltip.outside is
set to true.It is not rendered the same way in exported charts, unless you use the
experimental
exporting.allowHTML

foreignObject elements in SVG. This fixed the z-index issue, and works across
all modern browsers. Our goal is to make this the default behavior, but want to
try it out behind a flag first. To enable this feature, set
Highcharts.HTMLElement.useForeignObject to true. See the live demo of

Since v11.1 (2023) the templates support logic, and are generally recommended over formatter callbacks when the configuration needs to be secure and JSON compatible. The Highcharts templating style is inspired by well-proven languages like Handlebars and Mustache, but is more focused on numeric operations since charting is all about numeric data.ExpressionsExpressions in format strings are enclosed by {single brackets}. They can be simple variables or constants, or conditional blocks or functions called helpers.Variables and properties are inserted directly inside the bracket, for example "The point value at {point.x} is {point.y}". Nested properties are supported using the dot notation. Arrays are also indexed using dot notation, for example {series.xAxis.categories.0}, or more practical, with a subexpression {series.xAxis.categories.(point.x)}Numbers are formatted with a subset of float formatting conventions from the C library function sprintf. The formatting is appended inside the expression, separated from the value by a colon. Note that even though a dot and a comma symbolizes the decimal point and the thousands separator respectively, how it is actually rendered depends on the language settings. For example:Two decimal places: "{point.y:.2f}" [Demo]Thousands separator, no decimal places: {point.y:,.0f} [Demo]Thousands separator, one decimal place: {point.y:,.1f} [Demo, internationalized]Dates allow, like numbers, the format to be appended behind a colon. The format conventions allowed are the same as those of Highcharts.dateFormat(). For example:Full date: {value:%Y-%m-%d} [Demo]Locale-aware full date: {value:%[Ymd]} [Demo]HelpersHelpers define either a conditional block or a function to be used in an expression. Highcharts includes a number of built-in helpers, and allows custom helpers to be added.// Add two literal number using the `add` helperformat: '{add 1 2}' // => prints 3// Add a literal number and a variableformat: '{add point.index 1}' // => prints a 1-based index from zero-basedCopyBlock helpers include a block that is executed conditionally. Block helpers start with a #, and end with a closing expression. They may also include an {else} expression to execute if the condition is falsy.// A simple #if helperformat: '{#if point.isNull}Null{else}{point.y:.2f} USD{/if}'// A block helper looping through points, with nested expressionsformat: '{#each points}{add this.index 1}) {this.name}{/each}CopySee demo of an #each helper in a shared tooltip.Custom helpers can be defined by extending Highcharts.Templating.helpers. Each helper has a fixed number of arguments. A match object is then appended to the arguments, for use in case a block helper needs access to the context or the body of the block. Helpers can either return a boolean, in which case the helper works as a condition, or a string or number, in which case that is inserted for the whole block or expression.// Define a helper to return the absolute of a numberHighcharts.Templating.helpers.abs = value => Math.abs(value);// Use it like thisformat: 'Absolute value: {abs point.y}'CopyView live demo.SubexpressionsSubexpressions provide a powerful way to invoke multiple helpers, and pass the results of the inner helper to the outer helper. Subexpressions are delimited by parentheses.// Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion, where point.y is degrees Celsiusformat: '{add (multiply point.y (divide 9 5)) 32}℉'CopyWhen doing math like this, we sometimes end up with too many decimals or other results that we want to run through number or date formatting. In that case, we use a subexpression then apply the formatting as explained above.// Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion, where point.y is degrees Celsius.// Format the result with 1 decimal place.format: '{(add (multiply point.y (divide 9 5)) 32):.1f}℉'CopyView live demo.Subexpressions can also be used inside conditions to asses whether a statement is truthy.// A subexpression inside a condition. Decide plural form.format: 'The series exists of {points.length} ' +    '{#if (eq 1 points.length)}point{else}points{/if}.'CopyDebuggingOne of the downsides of working with string formats versus formatter callbacks is the ability to log and debug inside callback. To alleviate that, you can define custom helpers allowing you to inspect the context.// Custom helper to log the contextHighcharts.Templating.helpers.log = function () {    console.log(arguments[0].ctx);};// Usageformat: '{log}'CopyView live demo.Built-in helpersadd. Add two numbers. For example {add index 1} where index is a zero-based index from the context. Demo.divide. Divide the first number with the second. For example {divide 10 2} prints 5. Division by zero returns an empty string. Demo.eq. Returns true for loose equality (JavaScript ==) between the first and second argument. Can be used either as a block helper, {#eq index 0}First item{/eq}, or in a subexpression {#if (eq index 0)}First item{/if}.#each. Iterate over an array of items. The context of each child is given as {this} in the block body. Additional variables in the block body are @index, @first and @last. Example {#each points}{@index}) {name}, {#if @last}and {/if}. Demo.ge. Greater than or equal, JavaScript >=. Doubles as block helper and subexpression.gt. Greater than, JavaScript >. Doubles as block helper and subexpression.#if. Conditional block helper. {#if point.isNull}The point is null{else}The value is {point.y}{/if}.le. Less than or equal, JavaScript <=. Doubles as block helper and subexpression.lt. Less than, JavaScript <. Doubles as block helper and subexpression.multiply. Multiply two numbers. For example {multiply value 1000}. Demo.ne. Not equal, JavaScript !=. Doubles as block helper and subexpression.subtract. Subtract the second number from the first. Example {subtract 5 2} prints 3.#unless. The inverse of #if. {#unless point.isNull}The value is {point.y}{/unless}.LimitationsThe templating system only works on the context that is passed in to each item. For data label, the context is the point, for tooltip formats the context holds the series, points, suggested header, for axis labels it holds the axis value etc. In most of these cases the context holds deep access to DOM elements (for example through series.chart.container.ownerDocument), but these properties are not accessible in templates due to XSS filtering. Preventing DOM access is one of the reasons for choosing string formats over formatter callbacks.In cases where helpers are not sufficient to reach the desired formatting, it is better to preprocess the data set. Use the custom option for series and points, and access that from the format string.In the column-comparison demo, we prepare a lookup object for axis labels and the tooltip, append that to the options on chart level, and access it from the axis and tooltip format strings.Deprecated format functionsThe accessibility module prior to v11.1 had two advanced functions, #each() and #plural(). These have been deprecated and replaced in the default language strings by the new #each and #eq. See Advanced format strings on GitHub for details.\n\nTemplatingHighcharts supports templating in format strings.

They can be simple variables or constants, or conditional blocks or functions called helpers.Variables and properties are inserted directly inside the bracket, for example "The point value at {point.x} is {point.y}". Nested properties are supported using the dot notation. Arrays are also indexed using dot notation, for example {series.xAxis.categories.0}, or more practical, with a subexpression {series.xAxis.categories.(point.x)}Numbers are formatted with a subset of float formatting conventions from the C library function sprintf. The formatting is appended inside the expression, separated from the value by a colon. Note that even though a dot and a comma symbolizes the decimal point and the thousands separator respectively, how it is actually rendered depends on the language settings. For example:Two decimal places: "{point.y:.2f}" [Demo]Thousands separator, no decimal places: {point.y:,.0f} [Demo]Thousands separator, one decimal place: {point.y:,.1f} [Demo, internationalized]Dates allow, like numbers, the format to be appended behind a colon. The format conventions allowed are the same as those of Highcharts.dateFormat(). For example:Full date: {value:%Y-%m-%d} [Demo]Locale-aware full date: {value:%[Ymd]} [Demo]HelpersHelpers define either a conditional block or a function to be used in an expression. Highcharts includes a number of built-in helpers, and allows custom helpers to be added.// Add two literal number using the `add` helperformat: '{add 1 2}' // => prints 3// Add a literal number and a variableformat: '{add point.index 1}' // => prints a 1-based index from zero-basedCopyBlock helpers include a block that is executed conditionally. Block helpers start with a #, and end with a closing expression. They may also include an {else} expression to execute if the condition is falsy.// A simple #if helperformat: '{#if point.isNull}Null{else}{point.y:.2f} USD{/if}'// A block helper looping through points, with nested expressionsformat: '{#each points}{add this.index 1}) {this.name}{/each}CopySee demo of an #each helper in a shared tooltip.Custom helpers can be defined by extending Highcharts.Templating.helpers. Each helper has a fixed number of arguments. A match object is then appended to the arguments, for use in case a block helper needs access to the context or the body of the block. Helpers can either return a boolean, in which case the helper works as a condition, or a string or number, in which case that is inserted for the whole block or expression.// Define a helper to return the absolute of a numberHighcharts.Templating.helpers.abs = value => Math.abs(value);// Use it like thisformat: 'Absolute value: {abs point.y}'CopyView live demo.SubexpressionsSubexpressions provide a powerful way to invoke multiple helpers, and pass the results of the inner helper to the outer helper. Subexpressions are delimited by parentheses.// Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion, where point.y is degrees Celsiusformat: '{add (multiply point.y (divide 9 5)) 32}℉'CopyWhen doing math like this, we sometimes end up with too many decimals or other results that we want to run through number or date formatting. In that case, we use a subexpression then apply the formatting as explained above.// Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion, where point.y is degrees Celsius.// Format the result with 1 decimal place.format: '{(add (multiply point.y (divide 9 5)) 32):.1f}℉'CopyView live demo.Subexpressions can also be used inside conditions to asses whether a statement is truthy.// A subexpression inside a condition.

Add two numbers. For example {add index 1} where index is a zero-based index from the context. Demo.divide. Divide the first number with the second. For example {divide 10 2} prints 5. Division by zero returns an empty string. Demo.eq. Returns true for loose equality (JavaScript ==) between the first and second argument.

Doubles as block helper and subexpression.subtract. Subtract the second number from the first. Example {subtract 5 2} prints 3.#unless. The inverse of #if. {#unless point.isNull}The value is {point.y}{/unless}.LimitationsThe templating system only works on the context that is passed in to each item. For data label, the context is the point, for tooltip formats the context holds the series, points, suggested header, for axis labels it holds the axis value etc. In most of these cases the context holds deep access to DOM elements (for example through series.chart.container.ownerDocument), but these properties are not accessible in templates due to XSS filtering. Preventing DOM access is one of the reasons for choosing string formats over formatter callbacks.In cases where helpers are not sufficient to reach the desired formatting, it is better to preprocess the data set. Use the custom option for series and points, and access that from the format string.In the column-comparison demo, we prepare a lookup object for axis labels and the tooltip, append that to the options on chart level, and access it from the axis and tooltip format strings.Deprecated format functionsThe accessibility module prior to v11.1 had two advanced functions, #each() and #plural(). These have been deprecated and replaced in the default language strings by the new #each and #eq.

It currently allows to create 3D Column charts, 3D Pie charts and 3D Scatter charts.Load the required files.To be able to use Highcharts 3D you first have to load Highcharts as usual and load the additional 3D plugin module:<script src="https://code.highcharts.com/highcharts-3d.js"><script>Copy(This should be included after highcharts.js)Configuring the 3D options for a chart.Loading the 3D module will not alter existing charts unless they are specifically set up to be 3D, this allows you to have both 3D Charts and regular charts on one page. The configuration for the 3D chart in general is done the chart section of the options, while some specific settings for different chart type can be found under plotOptions; here you see the fully extended 3D options with the type of value it expects:chart: {    ....    options3d: {        enabled: 'boolean value',        alpha: 'numeric value',        beta: 'numeric value',        depth: 'numeric value',        viewDistance: 'numeric value',        frame: {            bottom: {                size: 'numeric value',                color: 'color value'            },            side: {                size: 'numeric value',                color: 'color value'            },            back: {                size: 'numeric value',                color: 'color value'            }       }   },   ...}...plotOptions: {    ...    column: {        ...        depth: 'numeric value',        groupZPadding: 'numeric value',        ...    },    ...    pie: {        depth: 'numeric value'    },    ...}CopyGeneralFor all 3D charts the following options are the most important (part of chart.options3d):enabled                   This indicates whether the chart has to have 3D or not, set this to true.depth                        The total depth of the chart, defaults to 100.viewDistance          This defines how far a viewer is from the chart.alpha & beta           The angles to rotate the view of the chart.Beware that setting a low viewDistance can result in twisted effects in the perspective because the view point is too close to the chart.In chart.options3d there is also the possibility to construct three panes around the chart called the frame, by default these panes are invisible but they can each be configured separately in chart.options.3d.frame:bottom|side|back: {    size:   The thickness of the pane (defaults to 0)    color:  The color of the pane (default to transparent)}Copy3D ColumnsA 3D chart of type columns will draw each column as a cuboid and thus create a 3D effect. By default the depth of this column is set to 25. To define another depth you have to go into the plotOptions and define one for the columns:plotOptions.column.depth: The depth of each individual column.CopyDisplaying multiple columnsJust like in normal column charts, the Highcharts 3D plugin does allow to display a series of charts and to order these as desired using techniques like grouping and stacking.By default, grouping is true in Highcharts, displaying the columns next to each other, in Highcharts 3D this is still the same: the columns will be standing next to each other on the front row of your chart. By setting grouping to false, the columns will be placed behind each other in order of appearance. The default behaviour is to place the columns without any spacing against each other, this can be modified by setting the groupZPadding optionplotOptions.column.groupZPadding: Spacing between columns on the z-axis.CopyMake sure the depth of the chart is sufficient to display all your columns. You will need at least the following depth: number of columns * (depth of column + z-padding)A regular Highcharts column chart also offers the possibility to stack columns together, this is of course still available in 3D charts and works in exactly the same way by setting stacking to true and defining a stack number for each series.3D PieFor a pie chart the depth of the total chart is not important and setting the frame does not do anything (the frame is linked to the axis line and pies do not have these in the same way the other charts have). For pie charts it is important to set the depth property in plotOptions.plotOptions.pie.depth: Defines the 'thickness' of the pie.Copy3D ScatterIn addition to x & y coordinates like in a regular scatter chart, the 3D plugin adds an extra z coordinate to each point to place in 3 dimensions. Similar to the normal chart these coordinates can be sent either literally or using an array:{x: 1, y: 1, z: 1} is the same point as [1,1,1]Copy3D AreaA 3D chart of type area is working similar to the column series. It will draw each area series as a 3D plane. By default the depth of an area series is set to 25.Displaying multiple areasJust like in normal area charts, the Highcharts 3D plugin does allow to display multiple area series and to order these as desired with grouping and stacking.Make sure the depth of the chart is sufficient to display all your area series. You will need at least the following depth: (number of area series - 1) * (depth of single area series)Stacking is still available in 3D charts and works in exactly the same way by setting stacking to true.\n\nGetting started with Highcharts 3D supportHighcharts 3D is a Highcharts module providing limited 3D support to charts.

To define another depth you have to go into the plotOptions and define one for the columns:plotOptions.column.depth: The depth of each individual column.CopyDisplaying multiple columnsJust like in normal column charts, the Highcharts 3D plugin does allow to display a series of charts and to order these as desired using techniques like grouping and stacking.By default, grouping is true in Highcharts, displaying the columns next to each other, in Highcharts 3D this is still the same: the columns will be standing next to each other on the front row of your chart. By setting grouping to false, the columns will be placed behind each other in order of appearance. The default behaviour is to place the columns without any spacing against each other, this can be modified by setting the groupZPadding optionplotOptions.column.groupZPadding: Spacing between columns on the z-axis.CopyMake sure the depth of the chart is sufficient to display all your columns. You will need at least the following depth: number of columns * (depth of column + z-padding)A regular Highcharts column chart also offers the possibility to stack columns together, this is of course still available in 3D charts and works in exactly the same way by setting stacking to true and defining a stack number for each series.3D PieFor a pie chart the depth of the total chart is not important and setting the frame does not do anything (the frame is linked to the axis line and pies do not have these in the same way the other charts have). For pie charts it is important to set the depth property in plotOptions.plotOptions.pie.depth: Defines the 'thickness' of the pie.Copy3D ScatterIn addition to x & y coordinates like in a regular scatter chart, the 3D plugin adds an extra z coordinate to each point to place in 3 dimensions. Similar to the normal chart these coordinates can be sent either literally or using an array:{x: 1, y: 1, z: 1} is the same point as [1,1,1]Copy3D AreaA 3D chart of type area is working similar to the column series. It will draw each area series as a 3D plane. By default the depth of an area series is set to 25.Displaying multiple areasJust like in normal area charts, the Highcharts 3D plugin does allow to display multiple area series and to order these as desired with grouping and stacking.Make sure the depth of the chart is sufficient to display all your area series. You will need at least the following depth: (number of area series - 1) * (depth of single area series)Stacking is still available in 3D charts and works in exactly the same way by setting stacking to true.Edit this pagePrevious« Drill down NextResponsive charts  »Load the required files.Configuring the 3D options for a chart.General3D ColumnsDisplaying multiple columns3D Pie3D Scatter3D AreaDisplaying multiple areas\n\nGetting started with Highcharts 3D supportHighcharts 3D is a Highcharts module providing limited 3D support to charts.
