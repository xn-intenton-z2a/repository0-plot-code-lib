Use plain JavaScript
              We love JavaScript. It's a totally friendly language. All templating languages grow to be Turing-complete. Just cut out the middle-man, and use JS!
            
              Fast development time
              Don't waste time and attention figuring out arcane new syntax because 'elegance' — or how to preprocess your data so it will actually render right.
            
              Simple syntax
              JavaScript code in simple, straightforward scriptlet tags. Just write JavaScript that emits the HTML you want, and get the job done!
            
              Speedy execution
              We all know how fast V8 and the other JavaScript runtimes have gotten. EJS caches the intermediate JS functions for fast execution.
            
              Easy debugging
              It's easy to debug EJS errors: your errors are plain JavaScript exceptions, with template line-numbers included.
            
              Active development
              EJS has a large community of active users, and the library is under active development. We're happy to answer your questions or give you help.\n\n\n\nUse plain JavaScript
