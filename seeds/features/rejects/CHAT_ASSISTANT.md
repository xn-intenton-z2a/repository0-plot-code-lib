# CHAT_ASSISTANT Feature Specification (Enhanced with Multi-turn Conversation and Offline Fallback)

## Overview
The CHAT_ASSISTANT feature introduces an interactive, AI-powered support layer to our plotting library. Leveraging the OpenAI API, this feature provides real-time, natural language assistance for configuration guidance, troubleshooting, and usage tips. Accessible via the CLI and the HTTP API, it assists both command-line users and remote clients. In this update, the feature has been refined to support multi-turn conversational context, offline fallback guidance, and improved caching of frequent queries, ensuring consistency and robust user support even during network disruptions.

## Implementation Details
### Integration with OpenAI and Conversation Management
- **OpenAI Integration:**
  - Utilize the `openai` package to process user queries and generate contextual responses based on the repositoryâ€™s documentation and in-app context.
  - Incorporate error handling and fallback mechanisms in case of API unavailability.
- **Multi-turn Conversation:**
  - Maintain session state to enable multi-turn conversations, allowing the assistant to remember previous messages during a session.
  - Provide continuity in responses for complex troubleshooting and configuration guidance.
- **Query Caching and Offline Fallback:**
  - Implement caching for frequent queries to reduce external API calls and speed up response times.
  - Precompile a set of fallback responses covering common issues and guidance in case of network disruptions.

### CLI and HTTP API Integration
- **CLI Invocation:**
  - Introduce a new CLI flag (e.g., `--chat`) that initiates an interactive chat session with real-time suggestions, contextual help, and multi-turn dialogue support.
- **HTTP Endpoint:**
  - Expose a `/chat` endpoint as part of the CLI_API feature to mirror chat functionality for remote clients.
  - Ensure unified processing logic between CLI and HTTP, preserving conversation context when applicable.

### Enhanced User Guidance and Proactive Suggestions
- **Proactive Assistance:**
  - Leverage conversation history to suggest relevant configuration changes and troubleshooting steps.
  - Integrate with the CONFIG_MANAGER to pull in current user settings and offer targeted advice.
- **User Interface Enhancements:**
  - Provide inline quick tips, contextual hints, and clarifications during chat sessions.
  - Ensure clear instructions and error recovery pathways are embedded within the conversation flow.

## Testing and Documentation
- **Unit and Integration Tests:**
  - Develop tests simulating multi-turn conversations, verifying that session state is maintained and that cached responses are used appropriately.
  - Test offline fallback by simulating network outages and ensuring that precompiled guides are provided instead of API calls.
- **Documentation Updates:**
  - Update README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md to include usage examples, CLI command instructions, and troubleshooting tips for both normal and offline scenarios.
  - Provide detailed setup guidelines and common Q&A examples for users initiating chat sessions.

## Benefits
- **Enhanced User Support:** Multi-turn conversation enables more natural, iterative interactions, reducing the learning curve and improving troubleshooting efficiency.
- **Robustness and Resilience:** Caching of frequent queries and offline fallback ensures consistent support even when the external API is unavailable.
- **Context-Aware Guidance:** Leveraging current configuration settings and conversation history, the assistant provides tailored, actionable suggestions that directly improve user experience.

## Summary
The updated CHAT_ASSISTANT feature enriches our plotting library by providing interactive, AI-driven assistance that supports multi-turn conversations and offline operation. By integrating enhanced caching, proactive suggestions, and seamless CLI/HTTP API functionality, this feature aligns with our mission to be the go-to plot library for formula visualisations, ensuring a superior and uninterrupted user experience.
