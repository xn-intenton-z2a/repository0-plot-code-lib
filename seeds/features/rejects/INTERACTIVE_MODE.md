# INTERACTIVE_MODE Feature Specification

## Description
This feature introduces an interactive command-line mode for the plotting library. When launched with the `--interactive` flag, the application will enter an interactive REPL-like session where users can iteratively input mathematical formulas, adjust parameters, and immediately preview plots. The interactive session will support command history, auto-completion for supported plot types (e.g., quadratic, linear, sine, cosine, etc.), and on-screen guidance to ensure a smooth user experience.

## Motivation
- **Enhanced Usability:** Provides a more engaging and dynamic way to work with the plotting tool, especially for users who prefer iterative and exploratory data visualization.
- **Immediate Feedback:** Users will see live updates and can experiment with different formula parameters without restarting the application.
- **Accessibility:** Simplifies the process for newcomers by offering inline help and suggestions, lowering the entry barrier for using the tool.

## Implementation Details
1. **CLI Integration:**
   - Detect the `--interactive` flag from the command-line arguments in the main entry point (`src/lib/main.js`).
   - Branch the execution flow to initiate an interactive session using Node's `readline` module.

2. **Interactive Session Features:**
   - **Prompt Interface:** Initialize a REPL interface that continuously prompts the user for input.
   - **Auto-completion:** Implement auto-completion for command keywords (e.g., plot types and commands like 'help' or 'exit').
   - **Input Validation:** Utilize the existing parsing logic to validate the formulas entered by the user.
   - **Dynamic Ploting:** Allow the interactive mode to generate plots on-the-fly. The plot output will be displayed or saved depending on user interaction.
   - **Help System:** Include a help command (`help`) to list available commands, plot types, and usage tips within the session.

3. **Feedback and Error Handling:**
   - Provide clear error messages for invalid inputs.
   - Allow users to re-enter or modify commands without restarting the session.
   - Log session activities for debugging and improvement purposes.

4. **Testing and Documentation:**
   - **Unit Tests:** Add tests to simulate interactive mode sessions, ensuring that the input prompt, auto-completion, and dynamic plotting trigger as expected.
   - **Documentation:** Update the README and the CONTRIBUTING guide with examples on how to run and utilize the interactive mode. Include usage examples such as:
     ```bash
     node src/lib/main.js --interactive
     ```
   - **User Guide:** Create a short guide on available commands within the interactive session.

## Usage
- Launch the interactive mode by using the following command:
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --interactive
  ```
- Within the interactive session, type `help` to view available commands and plot types.
- Enter a mathematical expression (e.g., `quad:1,0,0,-10,10,1`) to generate and preview a plot dynamically.
- Exit the mode by entering `exit` or pressing `Ctrl+C`.

This feature is designed to further our mission of being the go-to plotting tool by offering a flexible and user-friendly interface that caters to both new and experienced users.
