# Overview

The AUTOMATION feature unifies scheduled plotting and live file monitoring into a single, streamlined module. This feature automates routine tasks such as regenerating plots at set intervals and re-rendering visualizations when monitored files change, thereby reducing manual intervention and enhancing the overall user experience.

# Implementation Details

## Scheduled Plotting
- Introduce a CLI flag (e.g., `--schedule <interval>`) that enables users to set up periodic plot generation.
- Integrate with the existing PLOT_ENGINE to trigger automated execution of plotting routines based on a user-defined time interval.
- Allow configuration of output options (e.g., ASCII, SVG) directly from the scheduling setup.

## File Watching
- Implement file monitoring using Node.js's native file system watching capabilities (e.g., `fs.watch`).
- Monitor specified directories or files for changes, triggering automated re-generation of plots upon detection of modifications.
- Provide feedback via logs or CLI notifications to inform users of automatic updates.

# Testing and Documentation

## Testing
- Develop unit and integration tests to simulate file changes and validate scheduled tasks.
- Ensure that both components correctly trigger plot regeneration and properly handle error situations.

## Documentation
- Update README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md with comprehensive instructions and usage examples for setting up scheduled plotting and file monitoring.
- Include troubleshooting guidelines and configuration examples to assist new users.

# Benefits

- **Efficiency:** Automates repetitive tasks to save user time and reduce manual errors.
- **Responsiveness:** Ensures plots remain up-to-date with real-time file changes and scheduled intervals.
- **User-Friendly:** Simplifies the process of maintaining updated visualizations and integrates seamlessly with the existing CLI.

# Summary

By merging the scheduling and file monitoring capabilities that were previously handled separately, the AUTOMATION feature creates a robust, unified system for dynamic plot updating. This consolidation aligns with our mission to provide a go-to plot library for formula visualisations, ensuring both ease of use and high reliability.
