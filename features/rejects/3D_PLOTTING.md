# 3D_PLOTTING Feature Specification

## Description
This feature introduces three-dimensional plotting capabilities to the library. It enables users to generate 3D visualizations of mathematical functions, surfaces, and spatial data. By extending beyond traditional 2D plotting, users can explore complex relationships in multidimensional datasets.

## Motivation
- **Enhanced Visual Insight:** 3D plots offer a deeper understanding of multi-dimensional relationships, making it easier to interpret and analyze complex data.
- **Broad Application Spectrum:** Useful in scientific research, engineering, and advanced data analytics where spatial representation is critical.
- **Mission Alignment:** Elevates our mission by evolving our tool into the go-to library for innovative and comprehensive formula visualizations.

## Implementation Details
1. **CLI Integration:**
   - Introduce a new CLI flag (e.g., `--3d`) to trigger the 3D plotting mode.
   - Update the argument parser in `src/lib/main.js` to detect and process the `--3d` flag alongside existing commands.

2. **Rendering Engine Enhancements:**
   - Extend the current rendering pipeline to support three axes (X, Y, and Z).
   - Implement projection methods (such as isometric, perspective, or orthographic) to convert 3D data into 2D representations for static outputs (SVG, PNG) and interactive HTML.
   - Optionally integrate with external libraries (e.g., Three.js or a D3-based 3D module) for enhanced rendering and interactivity.

3. **Input Format and Validation:**
   - Define a new input format for 3D plots, for example: `surface:<expression>,<minX>,<maxX>,<minY>,<maxY>,<resolution>`. Example: `surface:sin(x)*cos(y),-10,10,-10,10,0.5`.
   - Reuse and extend the existing numeric validation routines to accommodate additional parameters for 3D domain definitions.

4. **Output and File Formats:**
   - Support multiple output formats including static (SVG, PNG) and dynamic (HTML with interactive controls).
   - Ensure that the generated 3D plot retains clarity and accuracy in different output settings, with options to adjust resolution and projection.

5. **Testing and Documentation:**
   - Add unit and integration tests to verify the correctness of 3D rendering, input parsing, and projection transformations.
   - Update the README and CONTRIBUTING guides to include usage examples and instructions for the 3D plotting feature.

## Usage
- **Basic 3D Plotting Mode:**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --3d output.svg "surface:sin(x)*cos(y),-10,10,-10,10,0.5"
  ```
- **Advanced 3D Interactive Output:**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --3d output.html "surface:exp(-((x/5)^2+(y/5)^2)),-10,10,-10,10,0.5"
  ```

This feature significantly broadens the plotting capabilities of the tool by enabling users to visualize mathematical functions in three dimensions, thereby supporting more advanced data analysis and presentation needs.
