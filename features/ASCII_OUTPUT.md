# ASCII_OUTPUT

## Overview
The ASCII_OUTPUT feature introduces support for generating plots in ASCII art format. This feature enables users to render mathematical function visualizations directly in the terminal using text characters. This is especially useful for quick previews, low-resource environments, or when graphical output is not feasible.

## Key Objectives
- **ASCII Rendering Engine:** Implement an efficient ASCII rendering engine that converts plot data into a text-based visualization.
- **CLI Integration:** Extend the command-line interface to recognize the `--ascii` flag, allowing users to generate and view ASCII plots.
- **Input Validation & Error Handling:** Utilize existing input validation routines to ensure formulas are correctly parsed and validated before ASCII rendering.
- **Multi-Mode Compatibility:** Ensure that the ASCII output mode works seamlessly alongside existing modes (SVG, JSON, Interactive CLI, and Web Interface).

## Design & Implementation
- **ASCII Renderer Module:** Create a dedicated module (e.g., `asciiRenderer.js`) that takes plot data (points, axes, labels) and converts it into a string representing an ASCII art plot.
- **CLI Flag Integration:** Update the main application logic (in `main.js`) to handle the new flag `--ascii` by invoking the ASCII renderer module when detected.
- **User Feedback:** Provide clear error messaging and usage instructions if invalid inputs are received in ASCII mode.
- **Testing:** Develop unit tests to cover typical and edge-case scenarios for the ASCII rendering output, ensuring consistency with the graphical representations.

## Usage Examples
- **Command-line ASCII Plot Generation:**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --ascii "sine:1,1,0,0,360,30"
  ```
- **Interactive Mode:** The interactive REPL should allow switching to ASCII output as an option when the user prefers a text-based display.

## Documentation & Integration
- Update the README to include usage examples and explanations for ASCII output.
- Ensure that the feature is covered by automated tests and adheres to the project's coding guidelines outlined in CONTRIBUTING.md.

This feature capitalizes on the repository's mission of providing versatile, lightweight, and accessible plotting solutions and expands the suite of supported output formats without compromising on usability or performance.
