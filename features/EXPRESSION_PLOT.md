# EXPRESSION_PLOT

This feature enhances the current CLI functionality by fully implementing parsing and validation of command-line arguments. In addition to the basic dry-run logging already in place, the application will now:

- Parse the following CLI arguments: `--expression`, `--range`, and `--file`.
- Validate the presence and format of these arguments and provide clear error messages when inputs are missing or malformed.
- Display a help/usage message if required arguments are not provided.
- Simulate the process of generating a plot by outputting a summary detailing the input expression, range, and file name, preparing the way for future integration of an actual plotting library.

## Implementation Details

- **Source File Changes (`src/lib/main.js`):**
  - Integrate robust argument parsing to extract values for `--expression`, `--range`, and `--file` from the command line.
  - Implement validation and error handling for missing options; if any required argument is absent, the tool will print a usage message.
  - Print a detailed summary of the provided arguments as a dry-run simulation of plot generation.

- **Testing (`tests/unit/main.test.js`):**
  - Extend existing tests to include scenarios with correct and incorrect argument combinations.
  - Validate that the application responds with appropriate messages or errors based on input.

- **Documentation (`README.md`):**
  - Update usage examples to reflect the enhanced CLI functionality with the newly supported arguments.
  - Provide clear instructions on the expected input format and error handling.

## Future Considerations

- Expansion to include actual SVG/PNG plotting based on provided mathematical expressions and range.
- Further refine input parsing with support for more complex data formats or additional CLI options if needed.

This enhancement aligns with our mission of making plot-code-lib the go-to CLI tool for generating visualizations from mathematical expressions, ensuring usability and robustness in the command-line interface.
