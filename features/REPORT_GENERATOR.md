# REPORT_GENERATOR Feature Specification

## Description

The REPORT_GENERATOR feature introduces the ability to automatically generate comprehensive, shareable reports alongside plot generation. These reports integrate the rendered plot (in formats such as SVG or PNG) with analytical insights, configuration details, and optional user commentary. The output, primarily in Markdown format, can serve as a robust documentation and presentation tool for users, enhancing reproducibility and communication of visual analysis.

## Motivation

- **Enhanced Documentation:** Automatically produce detailed reports that combine visual plots with analytical data, configuration settings, and context explanations.
- **Streamlined Sharing:** Facilitate easier sharing and archiving of analysis results by packaging plots and metadata into a single, coherent report.
- **Mission Alignment:** Supports our mission by turning the plotting tool into an all-in-one solution for formula visualizations, catering to both technical and non-technical audiences.

## Implementation Details

1. **CLI Integration:**
   - Introduce a new CLI flag (e.g., `--report`) to trigger report generation in addition to the standard plot output.
   - Allow additional parameters such as `--comment` to attach user-provided insights or contextual notes.
   - Ensure that report generation can be combined with other flags like `--analytics` to include computed analytics in the report.

2. **Report Content Structure:**
   - **Plot Embedding:** Embed the generated plot either as inline SVG code or as a reference to an output image file.
   - **Analytical Insights:** Include summaries of computed statistics (e.g., derivatives, integration, and statistical summaries) if analytics are enabled.
   - **Configuration Details:** Document the plot parameters and configuration settings used, ensuring reproducibility.
   - **User Commentary:** Optionally incorporate comments or annotations provided via CLI.

3. **Output Format Options:**
   - Primary output in Markdown format for easy readability and further conversion.
   - Option to integrate with external conversion tools for PDF export if needed.

4. **Error Handling and Testing:**
   - Validate that report generation does not conflict with other functionalities such as real-time plotting or batch processing.
   - Add unit and integration tests to ensure that all elements of the report (plot image, analytics, settings, and comments) are correctly captured and formatted.

## Usage

- **Basic Report Generation:**
   ```bash
   node src/lib/main.js output.svg "quad:1,0,0,-10,10,1" --report
   ```

- **Enhanced Report with Analytics and Comments:**
   ```bash
   node src/lib/main.js --analytics output.svg "sine:1,1,0,0,360,30" --report --comment "Preliminary analysis of sine function behavior."
   ```

This feature not only enriches the user experience but also bolsters the tool's capacity for generating professional, reproducible documentation of mathematical visualizations.
