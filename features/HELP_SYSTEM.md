# HELP_SYSTEM Feature Specification

## Overview
This feature provides an integrated help system for the repository, enhancing user experience through comprehensive, context-aware documentation accessible directly from the CLI. The help system will display command usage, operational examples, and guide users through the various functionalities provided by the tool. It is designed to be both informative and interactive, in line with our mission to be the go-to plot library for formula visualisations.

## Implementation Details
- **CLI Flag Integration:**
  - Respond to common help flags (`--help` and `-h`) by displaying detailed usage information.
  - Auto-detect the context based on provided subcommands (e.g., plotting, configuration, scheduling) and present relevant documentation.

- **Dynamic Documentation:**
  - Extract and format usage examples and command syntax from source code comments and updated documentation files (README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md).
  - Provide interactive prompts or paginated output when the help information is extensive.

- **Usage Examples and Guides:**
  - Include inline examples demonstrating how to invoke key features such as CONFIG_MANAGER, SCHEDULED_PLOTTING, ACTIVITY_MANAGER, PLOT_ENGINE, and CLI_API.
  - Link to updated online documentation and troubleshooting guidelines as part of the help output.

## Testing and Documentation
- **Unit and Integration Tests:**
  - Create tests to verify that the help output displays correctly for all supported commands and flags.
  - Simulate help invocation in both CLI and library use cases to ensure consistent behavior.

- **Documentation Updates:**
  - Update README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md to reference the new help system and provide instructions on accessing detailed usage information.
  - Document the help systemâ€™s architecture and integration points for future contributors.

## Benefits
- **Improved Usability:** Enables users to quickly get help on commands without leaving the CLI, reducing reliance on external documentation.
- **Context-Aware Guidance:** Automatically adapts help content based on the current command context, ensuring relevance and clarity.
- **Enhanced Onboarding:** Lowers the entry barrier for new users by providing a self-contained guide to the repository's comprehensive functionalities.

## Summary
The HELP_SYSTEM feature significantly enhances the repository by consolidating usage instructions and interactive documentation into a single, accessible interface. By providing immediate, context-sensitive help, this feature reinforces our mission and supports a seamless user experience for both command line and library interactions.
