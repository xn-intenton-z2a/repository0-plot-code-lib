# ACCESS_LAYER

## Overview
This update refines the ACCESS_LAYER module by ensuring complete and consistent diagnostics support across the CLI and the web API. In previous iterations, the diagnostics functionality was defined in the design documents but not fully implemented in the CLI's argument parser. This update adds the missing branch for the `--diagnostics` flag in the main execution flow, ensuring that system configuration, dependency information, and runtime diagnostics are output consistently in both human-readable and JSON formats.

## Key Objectives
- **CLI Diagnostics Integration:**
  - Update the CLI parser (in `src/lib/main.js`) to detect a `--diagnostics` flag early in the argument evaluation.
  - When the `--diagnostics` flag is provided, output detailed system configuration, environment variables, dependency versions (from package.json), and runtime diagnostics.
  - Format the diagnostics output in both a user-friendly and a JSON format to allow easy parsing by automated tools.

- **Web API Diagnostics Endpoint:**
  - Augment the Express-based web interface to provide a dedicated `GET /diagnostics` endpoint that mirrors the diagnostic output of the CLI.
  - Ensure that the logic is shared between CLI and API to keep the diagnostics output consistent.

- **Consistent Logging and Error Handling:**
  - Integrate robust error handling and logging for both CLI and API components dealing with diagnostics.
  
## Design & Implementation
### CLI Parser Enhancements (src/lib/main.js)
- Add a new branch to handle the `--diagnostics` flag before processing other arguments. 
- When `--diagnostics` is detected, aggregate system configuration details, environment variables, and dependency information from package.json.
- Output this information in two formats: a human-readable section and a JSON object.

### HTTP API Updates
- Extend the current Express server setup to include a new route (`GET /diagnostics`) that calls the same diagnostics logic used by the CLI.
- Apply the same validation and error handling strategies used elsewhere in ACCESS_LAYER to guarantee robustness.

### Testing and Documentation
- Update the unit tests (e.g., in `tests/unit/main.test.js`) to include scenarios for the new diagnostics flag.
- Revise both the README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md files to include examples and usage instructions for invoking diagnostics via the CLI and via HTTP.
- Ensure that the merged diagnostics functionality complies with the mission statement and design guidelines.

## Usage Examples
- **CLI Diagnostics:**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --diagnostics
  ```

- **Web Diagnostics Endpoint:**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --serve
  ```
  Then access diagnostics at:
  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:3000/diagnostics
  ```

This update makes the diagnostic functionality a first-class citizen in the ACCESS_LAYER module, ensuring that both the CLI and the web API provide consistent and comprehensive runtime diagnostics to users and developers.
