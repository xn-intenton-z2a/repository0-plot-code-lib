# ACCESS_LAYER

## Overview
This feature provides a unified interface for CLI operations including interactive sessions, diagnostics, onboarding tutorials, and alias management with enhanced import/export capabilities. The updated ACCESS_LAYER now integrates a robust interactive mode that guides users step by step, offering real-time command suggestions, dynamic error handling, and history logging. This update aligns closely with our mission, empowering users with a seamless plotting experience and robust CLI interactions.

## Key Objectives
- **Enhanced Interactive Mode:**
  - Provide a guided interactive session that supports real-time input validation, command suggestions, and error recovery.
  - Log command history to help users review past interactions and facilitate troubleshooting.
- **Extended Diagnostics:**
  - Support traditional diagnostics flags along with the diagnostic API endpoint to return alias and session details.
  - Offer detailed runtime metrics and system configuration data.
- **Unified Alias Management with Import/Export:**
  - Enable users to define, list, delete, export, and import CLI command aliases.
  - Validate alias conflicts and ensure compatibility with reserved commands.
- **Onboarding Tutorial Enhancement:**
  - Integrate an interactive onboarding tutorial to educate new users on the CLI usage and plotting commands.
  - Include dynamic walkthroughs based on user input to improve learning outcomes.

## Design & Implementation
- **CLI Parser Enhancements:**
  - Extend argument parsing in `src/lib/main.js` to fully support interactive sessions, diagnostics, alias management, and tutorials.
  - Introduce a subroutine for processing interactive commands with real-time suggestions and history logging.
- **Interactive Session Module:**
  - Develop a dedicated module to handle guided sessions that prompt the user for valid input and provide contextual help.
  - Integrate logs to capture session histories and command feedback.
- **Alias Configuration Module:**
  - Augment existing alias functionality to support robust import and export operations, ensuring configurations can be backed up and restored.
- **Web API Integration:**
  - Optionally extend the diagnostics HTTP endpoint to include interactive session logs and current alias configurations.

## Testing and Documentation
- Update unit and integration tests (e.g., in `tests/unit/main.test.js`) to cover new interactive session workflows, real-time feedback, and alias operations.
- Revise documentation in README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md to include examples and guidelines for using the enhanced interactive mode and alias management features.

## Usage Examples
- **Activating Enhanced Interactive Mode:**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --interactive
  ```
- **Alias Export/Import Commands:**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --alias export my_aliases.json
  node src/lib/main.js --alias import my_aliases.json
  ```
- **Accessing Onboarding Tutorial:**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --tutorial
  ```
