# Overview
This feature unifies and consolidates plot history management across both the CLI and HTTP API layers, eliminating duplication and ensuring consistency of history operations. It records user plot commands, supports tagging, individual record management (viewing, updating, and deletion), filtering, and export functionality. The unified history manager reinforces our mission to be the go-to plot library by providing reproducible, audit-friendly, and accessible history data through both local and remote interfaces.

# Implementation Details
- **Unified Data Store:**
  - Store history records in a JSON file (e.g., `history.json`) with each record containing parameters, timestamps, and optional tags.
  - Record structure supports fields such as formula, interval, step, colors, and export paths.

- **CLI Integration:**
  - Commands include viewing history, filtering (with tag or text queries), clearing all history, re-running a specific command via its unique identifier, updating record tags, and deleting individual records.

- **HTTP API Endpoints:**
  - **GET /history:** Retrieve a list of all history records with support for filtering by tags or text queries.
  - **PUT /history/:id:** Update metadata or tags of a specific history record.
  - **DELETE /history/:id:** Delete a specific record to remove sensitive or outdated commands.
  - **POST /history/export:** Export history data in JSON or CSV formats with the format selectable via a query parameter.

- **Benefits:**
  - Streamlines maintenance by reducing code redundancy.
  - Ensures consistency in history handling across both the CLI and HTTP API contexts.
  - Enhances usability by offering fine-grained control over history record management.

# Testing and Documentation
- **Unit and Integration Tests:**
  - Validate that history records are correctly logged, filtered, updated, and deleted via CLI commands.
  - Test HTTP endpoints to verify correct responses for listing, updating, deleting, and exporting history data.
- **Documentation Updates:**
  - Update the README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md files with clear usage examples and troubleshooting guidelines for history management.

# Usage Examples
- **CLI Commands:**
  - Record a plot with tags: `node src/lib/main.js --plot "sin(x)" --tag experiment,math`
  - View history with filtering: `node src/lib/main.js --history --query tag:experiment`
  - Delete a specific record: `node src/lib/main.js --delete-history <record_id>`
  - Update record tags: `node src/lib/main.js --update-history <record_id> --tag updatedTag1,updatedTag2`
- **HTTP API Endpoints:**
  - Retrieve all history: `GET http://localhost:3000/history`
  - Delete a record: `DELETE http://localhost:3000/history/<record_id>`
  - Update a record: `PUT http://localhost:3000/history/<record_id>` with JSON payload `{ "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"] }`
  - Export history: `POST http://localhost:3000/history/export?format=csv`
