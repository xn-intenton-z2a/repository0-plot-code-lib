# USER_INTERFACE Feature (Enhanced)

## Overview
This updated USER_INTERFACE feature consolidates and enhances the interactive aspects of our plotting library. It combines the command-line wizard, web API endpoints, and animated plot rendering (previously in the separate PLOT_ANIMATIONS feature) into a single cohesive interface. In addition, a new Command History capability has been added to improve usability by allowing users to review and re-execute previous commands, making the CLI experience more efficient and user-friendly.

## Key Enhancements
- **Unified Interaction:**
  - Merges CLI wizard functionality, web API endpoints, and animated plot rendering into a single interface. 
  - Provides context-sensitive help, dynamic plot previews, and real-time feedback across both command-line and HTTP interactions.

- **Enhanced CLI Experience:**
  - Retains step-by-step prompts, input validation, and integrated help content.
  - Introduces a new Command History feature that stores previous commands during a session. Users can navigate this history to re-execute or modify past plotting commands, improving efficiency for repeated tasks.
  - Leverages existing numeric and formula parsing routines from the CORE_ENGINE, including support for JSON-based parameter configuration and batch plotting commands.

- **Web API Integration:**
  - Exposes unified endpoints (e.g., `/api/plot`, `/api/preview`, `/api/history`) to mirror CLI functionalities. The new history endpoint provides a log of recent commands for session continuity.
  
- **Animated Plot Rendering & Preview Mode:**
  - Incorporates lightweight animated plot transitions that provide visual feedback. These animations were part of the former PLOT_ANIMATIONS feature and now blend seamlessly with the interactive CLI/web interface.
  - Offers a preview mode for quick, low-overhead confirmations before full plot rendering.

## Implementation Roadmap
1. **Merge Existing Functionalities:**
   - Integrate the animation routines from the former PLOT_ANIMATIONS feature directly into the USER_INTERFACE module.
   - Ensure that both CLI and HTTP endpoints offer identical preview and animation options using the unified CORE_ENGINE routines.

2. **Develop Command History:**
   - Implement in-memory storage for the current CLI session, with an option to persist history to a file in the user's home directory for longer sessions.
   - Add keyboard navigation (e.g., up/down arrow support) to allow users to scroll through previous commands.
   - Create an HTTP endpoint (`/api/history`) to fetch command history for web interface users.

3. **Synchronization & Testing:**
   - Ensure that command history works seamlessly with both advanced and non-advanced plotting commands. 
   - Update both unit and integration tests to cover new history functions along with enhanced UI interactions.
   - Update README and CONTRIBUTING documentation with examples of command history usage, including CLI shortcuts and API request examples.

## Benefits
- **Streamlined Experience:** Users benefit from a single, unified interface that minimizes context switching between CLI and web.
- **Improved Usability:** Command History enhances user productivity by making it easy to recall, modify, and re-execute previous commands.
- **Consistent Behavior:** Merging animation and preview functionality into the core user interface ensures a uniform experience across all entry points.
- **Maintenance Efficiency:** Consolidating multiple interactive elements reduces code duplication and simplifies future enhancements.
