# CLI_PARSER Feature Specification

## Overview
This feature provides a robust command-line interface parser responsible for parsing, validating, and routing various CLI flags. With the recent update, we have enhanced the parser to support shorthand aliases for common commands, increasing usability and aligning with our mission to be the go-to plot library. This update refines the existing parser by integrating auto-completion features, comprehensive flag validation, and now shorthand options to streamline command input.

## CLI Argument Parsing
- **Argument Mapping:**
  - Implements a lightweight parser (extending src/lib/main.js) to process full-length flags (e.g., `--plot`, `--diagnostics`, `--export`, `--log`, `--json-log`, `--help`) as well as their shorthand aliases (e.g., `-p` for `--plot`, `-d` for `--diagnostics`, `-e` for `--export`, `-l` for `--log`, `-j` for `--json-log`, and `-h` for `--help`).
  - Maps recognized flags to dedicated handler functions that delegate control to corresponding features such as PLOT_ENGINE, DIAGNOSTICS, HTTP_API, LOGGING, and DOCUMENTATION.
  - Supports common flag patterns including boolean flags and flags with optional values.

## Shorthand Alias Support
- **Alias Definitions:**
  - Introduce a configuration object that maps shorthand options to their full-length counterparts.
  - On parsing, the system will automatically expand any recognized shorthand flag into its full flag version before processing.
  - This enhancement reduces typing effort and lowers the barrier for new users.

## Auto-Completion Enhancement
- **Shell Script Generation:**
  - Provides an auto-completion subsystem that can generate shell completion scripts for bash, zsh, and fish with both full and shorthand flag suggestions.
  - A dedicated command (e.g., `--generate-completion`) outputs the auto-completion script to standard output.
  - Include installation instructions in the help documentation for setting up auto-completion in the respective shell.

## Help and Usage Display
- Expands the help display to include a dedicated section for shorthand flag usage and examples.
- When the `--help` or `-h` flag is provided, the application outputs a comprehensive help message detailing the available commands, their aliases, and usage scenarios.

## Integration and Error Handling
- **Validation:**
  - Checks for both the full and shorthand versions of flags, ensuring they are correctly interpreted and mapped.
  - Provides descriptive error messages for unrecognized or conflicting flag inputs.
- **Backward Compatibility:**
  - Existing behavior is preserved such that users who prefer full-length flags experience no change in functionality.

## Testing and Documentation
- **Unit Testing:**
  - Develop tests to simulate a variety of CLI inputs, including full-length and shorthand flag scenarios. Tests will confirm proper alias expansion, accurate flag parsing, and correct routing to respective feature handlers.
- **Documentation:**
  - Update README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md with clear instructions and examples showing how to use shorthand flags, as well as how to install the auto-completion scripts.

## Usage Example
- **Standard Usage:**
  - Full flag command: `node src/lib/main.js --plot "sin(x)" --log`
  - Shorthand equivalent: `node src/lib/main.js -p "sin(x)" -l`
- **Auto-Completion Script Generation:**
  - Command: `node src/lib/main.js --generate-completion`
