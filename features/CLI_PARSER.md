# CLI_PARSER Feature Specification

## Overview
This feature introduces a robust command-line interface parser to replace the basic argument logging in the current main entry point. The new CLI_PARSER will be responsible for parsing and routing various flags (e.g., --plot, --diagnostics, --export, --log, --json-log, --help) to their respective features. By centralizing CLI argument processing, this feature enhances user experience and simplifies integration between the CLI and library components.

## Implementation Details
- **Argument Parsing:**
  - Implement a lightweight parser directly within a single source file (e.g., extend src/lib/main.js) to process CLI flags and options.
  - Map each recognized flag to a dedicated handler function that delegates control to the corresponding feature (PLOT_ENGINE, DIAGNOSTICS, HTTP_API, LOGGING, and DOCUMENTATION).
  - Support common flag patterns, including flags with optional values (e.g., --export output.txt) and boolean flags (e.g., --json-log, --help).

- **Help and Usage Display:**
  - Integrate a help display that outlines all available commands and flags when the --help flag is provided.
  - Ensure the help documentation remains consistent with the information presented in the DOCUMENTATION feature.

- **Integration and Error Handling:**
  - Validate input flags and report descriptive error messages for unrecognized or improperly formatted arguments.
  - Maintain backward compatibility so that existing behavior is preserved if no CLI_PARSER enhancements are enabled.

## Testing and Documentation
- **Unit Testing:**
  - Develop unit tests to simulate various CLI input scenarios and validate that the parser correctly identifies flags and routes to appropriate handlers.
  - Cover edge cases, such as missing values for flags that expect arguments or unexpected flag combinations.

- **Documentation:**
  - Update README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md to include instructions and examples for using the enhanced CLI, including usage of the new --help flag.
  - Ensure that documentation references this feature as the central CLI integration point, providing clear examples for both CLI and library usage.

This feature aligns with the mission of delivering a user-friendly, go-to plot library by providing a consistent and robust command-line interface, facilitating both direct execution and library integration.
