# CLI_PARSER Feature Specification (Extended)

## Overview
This update enhances the existing CLI parser by incorporating robust input validation using the zod library. In addition to parsing flags like `--expression`, `--range`, and `--file`, the parser will now validate the input formats and provide informative error messages. This aligns with our mission to deliver a reliable and user-friendly plotting tool.

## Implementation
- **Source File (src/lib/main.js):**
  - Integrate zod for runtime validation of CLI arguments to ensure that `--expression` is a valid mathematical expression, `--range` conforms to a valid range format, and `--file` is a proper filename with a supported extension (SVG/PNG).
  - Enhance the CLI behavior by:
    - Printing a detailed error message when an argument is missing or does not meet the expected format.
    - Providing a help message when users invoke the tool with incorrect or insufficient parameters, guiding them towards correct usage.
    - Maintaining backward compatibility by falling back to simple logging when flags are not provided.

- **Test File (tests/unit/main.test.js):**
  - Add new test cases to simulate erroneous and correct combinations of CLI flags.
  - Validate that incorrect input produces the appropriate error messages and that correct input is accepted without regressions.

- **Documentation Updates (README.md):**
  - Revise the CLI usage section to include new examples featuring input validation and error feedback.
  - Document expected argument formats, common error scenarios, and troubleshooting steps.

## Dependencies
- Leverage the existing dependency on zod for input validation.

## Benefits
- Enhances user experience by providing clear, immediate feedback on input errors.
- Tightens control over data types and formats before proceeding with plot generation.
- Reinforces the reliability of the CLI tool, ensuring user inputs are both expected and safe to process.

## Testing
- Run `npm test` to ensure all new validations and error messages are triggered appropriately and that existing functionality remains stable.
