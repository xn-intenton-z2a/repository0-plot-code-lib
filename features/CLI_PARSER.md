# CLI_PARSER Feature Specification

## Overview
This feature introduces a robust command-line interface parser to replace basic argument logging in the main entry point. It is responsible for parsing and routing various flags (e.g., --plot, --diagnostics, --export, --log, --json-log, --help) to their respective handlers. In this update, the CLI_PARSER is enhanced to include support for auto-completion, providing users with command suggestions and improving usability.

## CLI Argument Parsing
- **Argument Mapping:**
  - Implements a lightweight parser in a single source file (e.g., extending src/lib/main.js) to process CLI flags and options.
  - Maps recognized flags to dedicated handler functions that delegate control to corresponding features (PLOT_ENGINE, DIAGNOSTICS, HTTP_API, LOGGING, DOCUMENTATION).
  - Supports common flag patterns including boolean flags (e.g., --json-log, --help) and flags with optional values (e.g., --export output.txt).

## Auto-Completion Enhancement
- **Shell Script Generation:**
  - Introduce an auto-completion subsystem that generates completion scripts for popular shells (e.g., bash, zsh, fish).
  - Provide a command (e.g., `--generate-completion`) that outputs the auto-completion script to standard output, which users can redirect to a file for installation.
- **Usage and Installation:**
  - Add instructions in the help documentation on how to install and activate the auto-completion scripts, enabling tab-completion for available CLI commands.
  - Ensure the auto-completion system remains lightweight and does not interfere with the primary CLI operations.

## Help and Usage Display
- Integrate an expanded help display that outlines all available commands and flags when the --help flag is provided.
- Include examples demonstrating how to use auto-completion and how to install the generated scripts.

## Integration and Error Handling
- Validate input flags and report descriptive error messages for unrecognized or malformed arguments.
- Maintain backward compatibility so that existing behavior is preserved when no CLI_PARSER enhancements are invoked.

## Testing and Documentation
- **Unit Testing:**
  - Develop unit tests simulating various CLI input scenarios, including tests for the auto-completion script generation and installation instructions.
  - Cover edge cases such as missing flag values or unexpected flag combinations.
- **Documentation:**
  - Update README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md to include instructions and examples for using the enhanced CLI parser and auto-completion feature.
  - Ensure the documentation references the CLI_PARSER as the central integration point for CLI operations, complete with a section on auto-completion usage.

This enhanced CLI_PARSER improves usability by streamlining flag parsing and providing user-friendly features like auto-completion, thereby reinforcing the mission of creating a go-to plot library with a robust CLI interface.
