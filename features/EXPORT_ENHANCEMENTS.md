# EXPORT_ENHANCEMENTS Feature Specification

## Description
This feature consolidates all export-related improvements into a single, cohesive module for the plotting library. It merges SVG optimization, PDF exporting, and customizable watermarking into one unified workflow. The feature streamlines post-plot rendering operations, ensuring that visual outputs are not only high-performance and optimized for web use but also ready for professional presentations and reports.

## Motivation
- **Performance and Quality:** Optimized SVG outputs ensure smaller file sizes and faster rendering, while PDF conversion provides scalable, publication-quality graphics.
- **User Convenience:** A single module for export enhancements reduces complexity in the codebase and in user configuration. Users can enable multiple enhancements with a unified set of CLI flags or web interface options.
- **Consistent Visual Branding:** Integrated watermark support allows users to maintain brand identity or secure intellectual property across all exports.
- **Mission Alignment:** By enhancing output formats and quality, this feature supports our mission of being the go-to plot library for formula-based visualisations, delivering a seamless experience in both CLI and web environments.

## Implementation Details
1. **Integration with the Rendering Pipeline:**
   - Post-process generated plots to apply SVG optimization, ensuring that redundant metadata is eliminated and file sizes are reduced without compromising quality.
   - Seamlessly convert optimized SVG or canvas outputs to PDF using a suitable conversion library (e.g., pdfkit), preserving all visual elements, styles, and annotations.
   - Apply customizable watermark options on the final rendered output, with support for both image and text watermarks. Parameters like position, opacity, and font styles should be configurable.

2. **CLI and Web Interface Support:**
   - Introduce CLI flags such as `--optimize-svg`, `--export-pdf`, and `--watermark` that can work individually or in combination.
   - In the web interface, provide a consolidated export settings panel where users can toggle export enhancements, preview changes, and configure options interactively.

3. **Configuration and Testing:**
   - Allow default settings to be configured via a user profile or configuration file, so that users can tailor the export process to their needs.
   - Develop comprehensive unit and integration tests to verify that each sub-feature (SVG optimization, PDF conversion, watermark application) works correctly both individually and in unison.
   - Document error handling thoroughly to guide users in configuring and troubleshooting export parameters.

## Usage
- **CLI Example:**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --import data.csv --plot "linear:column1,column2,-10,10,1" --optimize-svg --export-pdf output.pdf --watermark "Confidential"
  ```

- **Web Interface Example:**
   - Launch the web server using `npm run start:web`.
   - Navigate to the export settings panel, where users can toggle and configure SVG optimization, PDF output, and watermarking before finalizing the plot export.
