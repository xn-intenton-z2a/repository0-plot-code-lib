# SVG ENHANCEMENTS

## Overview
This update refines the SVG plot output to offer a more robust and customizable visualization experience. In addition to dynamic generation, adaptive dimensions, smooth curve rendering, accessibility enhancements, marker customization, and strict parameter validations (such as for smoothingFactor), the feature now supports enhanced stroke styling. Users can now specify custom stroke widths and dash patterns (via strokeWidth and strokeDashArray), as well as dynamic color gradients for the plot curve. This ensures that the SVG output can be tailored both visually and semantically to suit a wide range of publication and presentation requirements.

## Implementation
- Extend the current rendering logic to include new options for stroke styling on both the polyline and smooth path elements.
  - Validate that strokeWidth is a positive number and strokeDashArray is a non-empty string.
  - If provided, incorporate strokeWidth and strokeDashArray into the SVG element attributes along with existing stroke attributes.
- Maintain existing features:
  - Adaptive dimensions mapped from computed ranges.
  - Dynamic color gradient support with <defs> and linearGradient when enabled.
  - Marker definitions (markerStart and markerEnd) with conditional insertion of markers in the <defs> section.
  - Accessibility enhancements with customizable ARIA labels and svgRole.
  - Smooth curve rendering with quadratic Bezier commands when smoothing is enabled, validated by smoothingFactor between 0 and 1.
- Update error handling to provide clear feedback if strokeWidth or strokeDashArray values are invalid.

## Impact
- Empowers users to precisely control the aesthetic aspects of the plot, resulting in visuals that meet specific design or publication requirements.
- By integrating stroke styling options with existing SVG enhancements, the library continues to be a go-to tool for generating high-quality, accessible, and customizable plots directly from mathematical expressions.
- These updates further align with the mission of becoming the go-to plot library by blending core plotting functionality with detailed visual customization.
