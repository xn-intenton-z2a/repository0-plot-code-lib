# SVG ENHANCEMENTS

## Overview
This update refines the SVG plot generation feature to offer a highly customizable and accessible visualization experience. In addition to supporting adaptive dimensions, smooth curve rendering with optional Bezier interpolation, dynamic color gradients, marker support, and embedded metadata, this update expands the stroke styling options. Users can now specify custom stroke widths, dash arrays, and a new stroke line cap option to control how the endpoints of strokes are rendered. The strokeLinecap parameter accepts only three values – 'butt', 'round', or 'square' – and ensures that plots can be tailored for publication-quality visuals.

## Implementation
- Extend the SVG rendering logic to choose between a polyline and a smooth path when the smooth flag is enabled. For smooth curves, use quadratic Bezier commands with an adjustable smoothing factor.
- Validate and incorporate advanced stroke styling options:
  - Enforce that strokeWidth is a valid positive number. Throw an error if the input is invalid.
  - Ensure strokeDashArray is a non-empty string to define the dash pattern for the stroke.
  - Validate strokeLinecap against the allowed values ('butt', 'round', 'square'), throwing an error on invalid entries.
- Maintain dynamic color gradient support via a linearGradient definition when enabled, and retain marker definitions for optional markerStart and markerEnd enhancements.
- Embed detailed plot metadata as a data-metadata attribute in the SVG to support downstream processing and accessibility improvements, including customizable ARIA labels and text anchor settings for axis labels.

## Impact
- Empowers users to finely control the visual styling of plot curves, allowing for publication-quality customizations.
- Enhances accessibility and usability by ensuring consistent stroke styling with predefined options.
- Retains existing functionalities while extending the API to offer a more robust and customizable plotting experience.
