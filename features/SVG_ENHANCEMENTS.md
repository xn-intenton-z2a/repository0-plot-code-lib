# SVG ENHANCEMENTS

## Overview
This updated feature further refines the SVG plot output by not only supporting dynamic generation, advanced styling, adaptive dimensions, and smooth curve rendering but also by explicitly enhancing accessibility, marker customization, and error feedback. The enhancements include improved ARIA attributes and role settings, robust marker definitions for start and end points, and stricter validations on parameters such as smoothingFactor. These improvements align with our mission of creating a clear and reliable plot library, empowering users to generate high-quality visualizations with customizable appearance and accessibility in mind.

## Implementation
- Extend current rendering logic to support both polyline and smooth path generation with a new, stricter check for the smoothingFactor parameter. The smoothingFactor must be a floating-point number between 0 and 1. In case of invalid input, a clear error message is returned.
- Enhance dynamic color gradient support by ensuring that, when enabled, the SVG includes a <defs> section with a linearGradient element. The stroke of the plot now directly references the gradient if the colorGradient flag is set to true.
- Improve marker support by conditionally inserting marker definitions (for markerStart and markerEnd) within the <defs> section, and setting marker-start and marker-end attributes on the plot element. This ensures arrows or custom markers are correctly applied.
- Integrate accessibility improvements by incorporating ARIA labels for both x-axis and y-axis. Additionally, if a custom svgRole parameter is provided, the role attribute is added to the SVG root element. Text elements for axis labels now include customizable attributes such as text-anchor, font size, and fill color.
- Maintain adaptive dimension mapping: user-specified width and height can be provided and validated, with default fallbacks in place.
- Retain previous enhancements such as embedding plot metadata as a data attribute, dynamic axis label formatting (with precision and locale support), and detailed error handling for malformed ranges or expressions.

## Testing
- Update unit tests to verify that the smooth path is generated using a <path> element when smooth mode is enabled. Tests ensure that an invalid smoothingFactor (e.g., non-numeric or out of range) returns a clear error message.
- Validate that the presence of markerStart and markerEnd flags results in proper <marker> definitions in the <defs> section and correct marker attributes on the plot element.
- Confirm that ARIA attributes and the svgRole are correctly present in the SVG output, enhancing accessibility.
- Ensure dynamic color gradients are applied by checking that the gradient definitions and stroke attributes reference the proper color values.
- Re-run HTTP and CLI tests to verify that all enhancements (adaptive dimensions, smooth curves, marker support, accessibility, and error responses) continue to function as expected under various parameters.

## Impact
- Provides users with a more accessible and visually customizable SVG output by incorporating ARIA roles and labels, supporting compliance with best practices in web accessibility.
- Enhances the robustness of the plot generation process by enforcing stricter parameter validation (especially for the smoothingFactor) and improved error messages.
- Enables clearer visual communication using customizable markers and dynamic color gradients, which can be crucial for generating high-quality visualizations for publications or presentations.
- Supports the mission of becoming the go-to plot library by combining core functionalities such as adaptive resolution, smooth curve rendering, and comprehensive SVG enhancements in a single, maintainable repository.
