# LOGGING Feature Specification

## Overview
The LOGGING feature introduces a robust logging system to capture runtime events, errors, and user interactions. This will enhance debugging and provide users with a record of application behavior, which aligns with our mission of delivering a reliable and user-friendly plotting tool. Logging will be available as an optional CLI flag as well as programmatically from the library.

## Implementation Details
- **CLI Integration:**
  - Introduce a new `--log` flag in the main CLI (`src/lib/main.js`). When enabled, the application will write runtime information—including errors, warnings, and info messages—to a log file (default: `app.log`) or to a user-specified file path.
  - Allow configuration through environment variables (e.g. `LOG_LEVEL` and `LOG_FILE`) to control verbosity and log destination.

- **Logging Core:**
  - Use Node’s built-in `fs` module to append log messages to the designated file.
  - Implement log levels (INFO, WARN, ERROR) and timestamps for each log entry.
  - Ensure that logging does not interfere with the normal operation of the CLI, HTTP API, or the plotting engine.

- **Programmatic Access:**
  - Expose a logging utility function that can be imported and used within other modules. This will allow users to integrate the logging functionality into custom scripts or extended functionalities.

## Testing and Documentation
- **Testing:**
  - Add unit tests to simulate CLI calls with the `--log` flag and verify that log files are created and appended correctly.
  - Test error-handling within the logging functionality to ensure robustness, especially in file I/O operations.

- **Documentation:**
  - Update README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md to include instructions and examples on how to enable and configure logging.
  - Provide sample commands and expected log file outputs.

## Usage Example
- **CLI Command:**
  - Run: `node src/lib/main.js --plot "sin(x)" --log`
  - This command will plot the function and generate a log file capturing all relevant runtime events.

- **Library Example:**
  - Import the logging utility from the library and use it to record custom events:
  ```js
  import { logEvent } from './src/lib/logging.js';
  logEvent('INFO', 'Plot generated successfully');
  ```

> **Note:** To accommodate this new feature while keeping the repository within the maximum of 6 features, we propose merging the existing CLI_HELP and EXAMPLES features into a consolidated documentation feature. This merge will streamline the user help and example guides, ensuring that documentation remains clear and concise.
