# LOGGING Feature Specification

## Overview
The LOGGING feature introduces a robust logging system to capture runtime events, errors, and user interactions. In this update, we add support for JSON-formatted logging as an alternative to plain text logs. This allows better integration with log processing tools and improves the readability of logs for automated systems. This aligns with our mission of delivering a reliable, user-friendly plotting tool by enhancing observability and debugging capabilities.

## Implementation Details
### CLI Integration
- Extend the existing `--log` flag in the main CLI (src/lib/main.js) to include an optional `--json-log` flag. When enabled, all log entries will be formatted as JSON objects, including standardized keys for timestamp, level, and message.
- Allow configuration of log file destination and log level via environment variables (e.g., `LOG_FILE` and `LOG_LEVEL`).

### Logging Core
- Use Nodeâ€™s built-in `fs` module to append log entries. When `--json-log` is active, write each log entry as a JSON string terminated by a newline for easy parsing.
- Maintain log levels (INFO, WARN, ERROR) and timestamps for each entry. Ensure that both JSON and plain text modes are backward compatible and that switching modes does not alter existing plain text logs.
- Provide a utility function (e.g., `logEvent(level, message, options?)`) to be imported and used across the repository. The function should check for the JSON mode flag and format the output accordingly.

### Programmatic Access
- Expose the logging utility to allow integration in both CLI commands and library functions. This ensures that modules like DIAGNOSTICS and HTTP_API can log events in a unified format, either as plain text or JSON.

## Testing and Documentation
### Testing
- Develop unit tests simulating CLI calls with both `--log` and `--json-log` flags to verify that logs are correctly formatted and written to the designated file.
- Test error-handling for file I/O operations and ensure that logging failures do not interfere with core application functionality.

### Documentation
- Update README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md with clear instructions on how to enable and configure JSON logging. Include usage examples demonstrating how to switch between plain text and JSON log formats.
- Provide troubleshooting guidelines for common logging issues, such as file permission errors or misconfigured environment variables.

## Usage Example
- **Plain Text Logging:**
  - CLI Command: `node src/lib/main.js --plot "sin(x)" --log`
- **JSON Logging:**
  - CLI Command: `node src/lib/main.js --plot "sin(x)" --log --json-log`
  - This will output logs in JSON format, making them suitable for automated analysis.

This update reinforces our commitment to robust, flexible logging and enhances our ability to diagnose issues rapidly, supporting both developers and end-users.
