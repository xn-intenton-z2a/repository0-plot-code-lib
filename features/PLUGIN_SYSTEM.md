# PLUGIN_SYSTEM Feature Specification

## Description
This feature introduces a plugin system for the plotting library. It enables developers and users to extend the functionality of the tool by creating, integrating, and managing custom plugins. Plugins can provide new plot types, custom analytical tools, alternative output formats, or integration with external data sources.

## Motivation
- **Extensibility:** Empower users and contributors by allowing them to add new features without modifying the core codebase.
- **Customization:** Facilitate domain-specific enhancements and tailor-made plotting solutions.
- **Community Contributions:** Encourage external contributions by allowing third-party developers to build and share plugins.

## Implementation Details
1. **Plugin Discovery:**
   - Create a dedicated directory (e.g., `plugins/`) where user-defined plugin modules can reside.
   - Implement a discovery mechanism that scans this directory at startup for valid plugin modules.

2. **Plugin Interface:**
   - Define a clear API contract for plugins. For example, each plugin should export an initialization function and metadata (name, description, version).
   - Provide hooks in the main CLI and web interface to register and invoke plugin behaviors.

3. **CLI Integration:**
   - Introduce a new CLI flag (e.g., `--plugins`) to enable or list active plugins.
   - Allow users to specify one or more plugins to load during runtime.

4. **Error Handling and Isolation:**
   - Ensure that errors within a plugin do not affect the core functionality of the plotting tool.
   - Implement logging and sandboxing measures to warn users if a plugin causes issues.

5. **Documentation and Testing:**
   - Update the README and CONTRIBUTING files with guidelines on how to create and integrate plugins.
   - Write unit tests to verify the plugin loading process, API compliance, and error isolation.

## Usage
- **Enable Plugin Mode:**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --plugins
  ```
- **Specify Plugins:**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --plugins customHeatmap,advancedTransform output.svg "sine:1,1,0,0,360,30"
  ```
- **Plugin Development:**
  - Place your plugin modules in the `plugins/` directory.
  - Follow the provided API contract to ensure compatibility with the plotting tool.

This feature aligns with our mission by turning our plotting tool into an extensible platform that adapts to diverse visualization needs, modernizing and future-proofing its capabilities.
