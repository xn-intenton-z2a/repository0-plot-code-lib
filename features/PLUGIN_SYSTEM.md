# PLUGIN_SYSTEM Feature Specification

## Description
This feature introduces a modular plugin system which allows third-party developers and advanced users to extend the plotting library without modifying the core code. The plugin system enables the addition of custom plot types, data transformers, and new analytical functions through a well-defined API. Plugins can be integrated via CLI or the web interface, and can dynamically interact with the core plotting engine.

## Motivation
- **Extensibility:** Allow the community to contribute custom functionality, fostering innovation and adaptability to diverse user needs.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Maintain a clean and maintainable codebase by isolating experimental or add-on features within separate modules.
- **Mission Alignment:** Reinforce our mission to be the go-to plot library by offering a flexible, formula-based visualization tool that can evolve with user requirements.

## Implementation Details
1. **Plugin Interface:**
   - Define a clear API for plugins including initialization, registration, and execution hooks.
   - Allow plugins to access and modify plot configurations, data preprocessing routines, and rendering options.

2. **CLI and Web Integration:**
   - Introduce a new CLI flag (e.g., `--plugin <plugin_file>`) to load external plugins at runtime.
   - Provide a dedicated section in the web interface for managing installed plugins, including activation, deactivation, and configuration.

3. **Configuration and Discovery:**
   - Support auto-discovery of plugins located in a designated directory or specified via a configuration file.
   - Use schema validation (e.g., zod) to validate plugin metadata and ensure compatibility with the core system.

4. **Security and Isolation:**
   - Implement sandboxing measures where possible to prevent plugins from adversely affecting the core application.
   - Enforce strict versioning and compatibility checks to ensure that only trusted plugins are loaded.

5. **Testing and Documentation:**
   - Develop comprehensive unit and integration tests simulating plugin loading, execution, and error handling.
   - Update the README and CONTRIBUTING documentation with detailed guidelines for developing, installing, and troubleshooting plugins.

## Usage
- **CLI Example:**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --plugin ./plugins/myCustomPlugin.js "linear:column1,column2,-10,10,1"
  ```
- **Web Interface Example:**
   - Navigate to the plugin management section within the web interface.
   - Install, enable, and configure plugins through an interactive UI, with real-time feedback on how the plugin affects plot settings.
