# PLUGIN_SYSTEM Feature

## Overview
This feature introduces a modular plugin system that enables dynamic extension of plotting functionalities without modifying the core codebase. It allows third-party and internal plugins to integrate with the CLI wizard, diagnostics mode, and even the web API. The PLUGIN_SYSTEM reinforces our mission by making the plotting library adaptable, extensible, and future-proof for additional plot types and functionalities.

## Architecture & Implementation
- **Module Creation:**
  - Develop a dedicated module, e.g., `src/lib/pluginSystem.js`, managing plugin registration, initialization, and lifecycle events.
  - Provide well-defined interfaces for plugins to register callbacks or hooks that the core engine can invoke.
- **Integration with CORE_ENGINE:**
  - Enhance the interactive CLI wizard and diagnostics mode to load and display plugin statuses.
  - Allow plugins to contribute additional plot types or modify existing behavior dynamically through hook registration.
- **Web API Compatibility:**
  - Expose endpoints within the unified WEB_API to allow querying available plugins and triggering plugin-specific actions if needed.
- **Error Handling & Safety:**
  - Incorporate robust error handling to ensure that a malfunctioning plugin does not compromise the main functionality.
  - Log plugin loading events and errors for easier troubleshooting, following the same logging practices used in numeric validations.

## Usage Examples
- **CLI Integration:**
  - Register a plugin that adds a new plot type (e.g., a custom heatmap) to the interactive CLI wizard.
  - Diagnostics mode will display all loaded plugins and their statuses to aid in troubleshooting.

- **Web API Integration:**
  - Provide an API endpoint (e.g., `/plugins`) in the web interface to list registered plugins and available extensions.

## Documentation & Testing
- Update the README and CONTRIBUTING guidelines to include details on how to develop and integrate plugins.
- Add unit tests in `tests/unit/` to cover plugin registration, execution, and failure scenarios.
- Ensure that integration tests validate the interoperability between plugins and core plotting mechanisms.

## Benefits
- **Extensibility:** Facilitate third-party contributions and experimental features without altering core logic.
- **Modularity:** Enable clean separation between core functionalities and extended features offered by plugins.
- **Enhanced Diagnostics:** Improve monitoring of plugin health and performance, aiding both developers and users in troubleshooting.

## Future Opportunities
- Introduce a marketplace or repository of plugins that users can browse and install dynamically.
- Extend the PLUGIN_SYSTEM to support versioning, dependency resolution, and safe updates.
