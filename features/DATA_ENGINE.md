# DATA_ENGINE Feature Specification

## Description
This feature merges data ingestion, statistical analysis, and exporting capabilities into one cohesive module. The unified DATA_ENGINE allows users to import datasets (CSV and JSON), perform on-the-fly statistical computations (mean, median, mode, standard deviation, quartiles, etc.), and export both analytical summaries and plot data in various output formats (SVG, JSON, CSV, Markdown, ASCII, HTML).

## Motivation
- **Streamlined Workflow:** Consolidating data processing and export functions into one feature reduces complexity and the need for users to toggle between multiple modules.
- **Enhanced Insight and Usability:** Users receive immediate feedback on imported data through summary statistics while conveniently exporting the results for reports or further analysis.
- **Mission Alignment:** By integrating robust data management with flexible export options, this feature bolsters our mission to be the go-to plot library for formula-based visualizations, supporting both CLI and web interactions.

## Implementation Details
1. **Data Importation:**
   - Implement a unified CLI flag (e.g., `--import <filePath>`) to support CSV and JSON formats.
   - Detect file types based on file extension and parse the content into structured data ready for plotting and analysis.
   - Validate imported data to ensure it meets requirements for subsequent processing.

2. **Statistical Analysis:**
   - Integrate statistical functions (using libraries like mathjs) to compute key summary metrics such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, quartiles, and range.
   - Provide options via an additional CLI flag (e.g., `--stats [overlay|console|export]`) to either overlay statistics on plots, print them to the console, or output them to a file.
   - Ensure robust error handling for non-numeric or missing data.

3. **Export Functionality:**
   - Add support for exporting datasets and analysis results in multiple formats: SVG, JSON, CSV, Markdown, ASCII, and HTML.
   - Introduce a new CLI flag (e.g., `--export <format>`) that allows users to specify the desired output format.
   - In the web interface, update the configuration panel to include export options, enabling users to download visualizations and statistical reports in the preferred format.

4. **CLI and Web Interface Integration:**
   - Update the existing CLI to accept combined flags for data import, analysis, and export in a single command.
   - Enhance the web interface with panels for data submission, real-time statistical summaries, and export controls for different output formats.

5. **Testing and Documentation:**
   - Expand unit and integration tests to cover the full data workflow: import, analysis, and export.
   - Update documentation in the README and CONTRIBUTING files with detailed usage examples, including examples of exporting data in various formats.

## Usage

- **CLI Example:**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --import data.csv --stats console --export SVG
  ```

- **Web Interface Example:**
  - Start the web server with `npm run start:web`.
  - Use the data submission panel to load a dataset, view live statistical summaries, and select an export format to download the results.
