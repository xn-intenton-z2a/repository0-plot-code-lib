# ANNOTATIONS Feature Specification

## Description
This feature adds support for annotations to the plotting library. Users will be able to embed descriptive texts, markers, arrows, and other graphical cues directly into their plots to highlight important data points or trends. Annotations improve the clarity of complex visualizations by allowing users to provide contextual insights and guide the interpretation of the generated plots.

## Motivation
- **Enhanced Data Storytelling:** Allow users to explain intricate data features, such as outliers or inflection points, by adding descriptive labels and markers.
- **User Guidance:** Enable users to highlight key areas within a plot, making it easier for viewers to quickly identify significant trends.
- **Mission Alignment:** This feature reinforces our mission by adding a layer of interactivity and detail to our formula-based visualizations, ensuring that our tool remains the go-to library for comprehensive plotting needs.

## Implementation Details
1. **CLI Integration:**
   - Introduce a new CLI flag (e.g., `--annotate`) that accepts annotation parameters. For example, users can specify coordinates, text, and optional styling parameters.
   - Allow multiple annotations to be passed in a single command, possibly using a delimiter such as `|` to separate different annotations.

2. **Parameter Parsing and Validation:**
   - Extend the existing parameter parsing logic (as seen in numeric validations) to incorporate annotation details including `x`, `y`, and `text` values. 
   - Implement validation routines to ensure that annotation coordinates are numerical and the annotation text is non-empty.

3. **Rendering Engine Enhancements:**
   - Modify the rendering pipeline to support an additional annotation layer on top of the plot, ensuring that annotations are rendered clearly without overlapping critical plot elements.
   - Support customization such as font size, color, and arrow styles so that annotations can be tailored to diverse visualization needs.

4. **Web Interface Integration:**
   - Update the web interface to allow interactive placement of annotations. Users should be able to click on areas of a plot to add annotations, modify their positions, and edit text using a simple GUI.
   - Provide real-time previews of annotations as they are added or modified, enhancing the overall user experience.

5. **Testing and Documentation:**
   - Develop unit tests to cover the parsing and rendering of annotations, ensuring that both CLI and web interface inputs are handled correctly.
   - Update the README and CONTRIBUTING guidelines with examples and usage scenarios showcasing how to add annotations via the CLI and interactively through the web interface.

## Usage
- **CLI Example:**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js output.svg "line:1,2,3,4" "--annotate x:100,y:200,text:'Peak Value',fontSize:12,color:#FF5733 | x:150,y:250,text:'Trend Change'"
  ```
- **Web Interface Example:**
   - Launch the web server with `npm run start:web` and navigate to the plotting interface.
   - Use the annotation tool to click on the plot and add custom labels, adjust positioning and styling via an interactive overlay.
