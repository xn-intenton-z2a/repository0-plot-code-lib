# JQ_FILTER Feature Specification

## Overview
This feature introduces a lightweight JSON filtering utility that mimics the behavior of jq for processing plot data and configuration outputs. Users can leverage familiar filter expressions directly from the CLI to query and manipulate JSON output produced by the plotting engine and other modules. This aligns with our mission to be the go-to tool for formula visualisations by streamlining data interrogation and integration with other tools.

## Implementation Details
- **Single Source File:** Implement as a dedicated module (e.g., `src/lib/jqFilter.js`) that parses JSON outputs and applies filter expressions provided via CLI flags.

- **CLI Integration:**
  - Add a new CLI flag `--jq` which accepts a filtering expression.
  - Allow chaining with existing commands so that after generating JSON output, the result can be piped through the jq filter.

- **Filter Expression Parsing:**
  - Utilize native JavaScript operations or minimal third-party libraries to interpret simple query expressions (e.g., dot notation, array filtering, and basic comparisons).
  - Provide error handling for invalid expressions with descriptive messages.

- **Usage Workflow:**
  - Users generate output via the PLOT_ENGINE or CONFIG_MANAGER and then apply the `--jq` flag to extract relevant information.
  - Output remains in JSON format after filtering for further processing or readability.

## Testing and Documentation
- **Unit and Integration Tests:**
  - Develop tests that simulate various input scenarios and query expressions to validate correct filtering and error messages.
  - Ensure compatibility with both local and remote configuration outputs.

- **Documentation Updates:**
  - Update README.md with examples showcasing the usage of the `--jq` flag in combination with plotting commands.
  - Add usage instructions and troubleshooting guidelines to CONTRIBUTING.md and user documentation.

## Benefits
- **Enhanced Data Interrogation:** Empowers users with familiar jq-like syntax to quickly extract and manipulate JSON data from the tool.
- **Streamlined Workflows:** Enables effective chaining of commands, promoting improved integration with other data processing pipelines.
- **Accessibility:** Simplifies data exploration for users who rely on JSON for further visualization or custom post-processing.

## Summary
The JQ_FILTER feature augments the repository by delivering a dedicated JSON querying tool that complements existing plotting and configuration functionalities. This enhancement promotes a cleaner, more flexible workflow for users, making it easier to derive actionable insights from complex data outputs.
