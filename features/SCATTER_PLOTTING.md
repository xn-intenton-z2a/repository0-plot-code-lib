# SCATTER_PLOTTING Feature Specification

## Description
This feature introduces scatter plotting capabilities to the plotting library. It allows users to visualize the relationship between two numerical variables through a series of discrete points on a Cartesian plane. The scatter plotting mode is designed to handle large datasets and offer customizable visual options such as point size, color, and opacity. In addition to standard CLI outputs (like SVG, PNG, and ASCII), the feature can integrate with our web interface for interactive exploration.

## Motivation
- **Enhanced Data Analysis:** Scatter plots are indispensable for highlighting correlations, clusters, and outliers in data. 
- **Broad Use Cases:** Widely used in statistics, scientific research, and business analytics, scatter plotting extends our tool's effectiveness in data visualization.
- **Mission Alignment:** Expands our mission of being the go-to plot library by offering a robust module for detailed formula and dataset analysis, complementing our diverse plotting capabilities.

## Implementation Details
1. **CLI Integration:**
   - Introduce a new command format (e.g., `scatter:x1,y1;x2,y2;...`) or a dedicated flag (e.g., `--scatter`) to activate scatter plotting mode.
   - Update the argument parser in `src/lib/main.js` to recognize scatter plot input formats and validate coordinate pairs.

2. **Data Parsing and Validation:**
   - Parse input strings containing coordinate pairs separated by semicolons. Each pair should be comma-separated values representing an (x, y) coordinate.
   - Extend the existing numeric validation routines to handle multiple coordinate validations and provide user-friendly error messages if parsing fails.

3. **Rendering Engine Enhancements:**
   - Modify the current rendering pipeline to accommodate discrete point plotting. Allow customization such as point color, size, and marker style via additional parameters.
   - Support multiple output formats including static (SVG, PNG) and text-based (ASCII) by providing appropriate rendering logic.

4. **Customization and Theming:**
   - Integrate with the existing theme management system to allow users to apply custom color schemes and styles to scatter plots.
   - Provide options in configuration files and CLI flags to override default appearance settings.

5. **Testing and Documentation:**
   - Add unit and integration tests to cover scenarios like correct parsing of coordinate strings, handling malformed inputs, and rendering outputs across different formats.
   - Update the README, CONTRIBUTING, and API documentation to include usage examples, parameter descriptions, and troubleshooting tips for scatter plotting.

## Usage
- **Basic Scatter Plot Example:**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js output.svg "scatter:1,2;3,4;5,6;7,8"
  ```
- **Customizing Appearance:**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js output.svg "scatter:1,2;3,4;5,6;7,8,pointSize:5,pointColor:#FF5733"
  ```

This feature will add valuable functionality for users who need to visualize relationships between paired data points, increasing the versatility and analytical power of the plotting tool.
