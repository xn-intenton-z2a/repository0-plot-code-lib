# WEB_DOCS Feature Specification

## Overview
This feature introduces a static documentation website generator that extends the capabilities of the existing DOCS_GENERATOR. While DOCS_GENERATOR extracts and updates Markdown files directly from code comments and test descriptions, WEB_DOCS transforms these documents into a modern, navigable, and searchable website. The website will serve as a central resource for users and contributors, aligning with our mission by providing an accessible and attractive presentation of the plotting library's functionalities.

## Implementation Details
- **Single Source File:** Implement the WEB_DOCS generator in a single source file (e.g., `src/lib/webDocs.js`).
- **Markdown to HTML Conversion:** Utilize a Markdown parser (such as markdown-it) to convert auto-generated Markdown files into HTML content.
- **Static Website Structure:** Construct a simple one-page application with navigation, a search bar, and responsive design. Optionally include a CSS framework for clean UI styling.
- **CLI Integration:** Add a CLI flag (e.g., `--generate-webdocs`) to trigger the website generation process as part of the build or development pipeline.
- **Customization Options:** Allow users to specify a theme, custom CSS, and configuration via a JSON file or CLI arguments.
- **Deployment Ready:** Produce output in a designated folder (e.g., `docs/`) that can be easily deployed to GitHub Pages or any static hosting service.

## Testing and Documentation
- **Unit Tests:** Include tests to validate Markdown conversion, file output integrity, and CLI flag handling. Use vitest for these tests.
- **Integration Tests:** Simulate an end-to-end documentation generation process to ensure that the website correctly reflects the updated Markdown documents.
- **Documentation Updates:** Update the README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md files with examples for using the WEB_DOCS feature, including a demo of the generated website.

## Benefits
- **Enhanced Accessibility:** Transforms static Markdown documentation into an interactive and user-friendly website, improving onboarding and usability for both end users and contributors.
- **Centralized Information:** Consolidates documentation, usage examples, and API references in a single, navigable resource that complements the plotting library's mission.
- **Ease of Deployment:** Generates a ready-to-deploy static site from a single command, ensuring that documentation remains up-to-date with minimal manual effort.

## Summary
The WEB_DOCS feature builds on existing documentation automation by providing a modern, static website that is easily accessible to the community. It enhances the repository's overall usability and aligns with our mission of being the go-to plot library by ensuring that comprehensive and attractive documentation is always available.
