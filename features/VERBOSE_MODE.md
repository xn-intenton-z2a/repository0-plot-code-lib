# VERBOSE_MODE Feature Specification

## Overview
This feature adds a verbose mode to the CLI tool. When the --verbose flag is provided, the tool logs additional internal state details and debugging information. This enhances user understanding of the processing steps and aids in troubleshooting and validation of inputs and outputs.

## Implementation Details
1. Update CLI Parsing:
   - Extend the argument parsing to include an optional boolean flag --verbose (default to false) using Zod schema. This flag should be added alongside other optional flags like --json.

2. Verbose Logging:
   - After the arguments are validated and main processing is performed, check for the verbose flag. When enabled, log detailed information including:
     - The validated command-line arguments object.
     - The computed xRange and yRange values from the provided range string.
     - The full list of generated (x,y) points before final output.
   - Ensure that verbose logs are displayed only in text output mode (i.e., when file output is not provided) to avoid interference with file generation.

3. Integration in Main Function:
   - Add conditional statements to log additional details if --verbose is set. These logs should be clear and structured.

4. Testing and Documentation:
   - Update the test files to include cases where the --verbose flag is provided. Tests should capture and verify that additional log messages appear.
   - Update the README and USAGE documentation to inform users about the new --verbose flag and its benefits for debugging and demonstration purposes.

## Expected Impact
- Provides enhanced transparency of internal operations.
- Aids users in debugging issues with input parameters and understanding the plot generation process.
- Increases user trust by offering a clear insight into how inputs are processed.
