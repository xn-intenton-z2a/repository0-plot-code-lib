# CLI_AUTOCOMPLETE Feature Specification

## Description
This feature introduces command-line autocompletion support for the plotting tool. It will enable users to receive context-sensitive suggestions for command flags, sub-commands, and numeric parameter tokens directly in their shell. The autocompletion feature is designed to work with common shells (such as Bash, Zsh, and Fish) and aims to streamline the user experience by reducing the need to memorize command syntax or refer continuously to the documentation.

## Motivation
- **Improved Usability:** Enhance the overall experience for both new and experienced users by providing command suggestions and tab-completion support.
- **Error Reduction:** By offering accurate suggestions, the feature reduces the risk of syntax errors, especially when entering complex numeric parameters and advanced plot types.
- **Mission Alignment:** Supporting our mission to be the go-to plot library, this feature ensures that working with the CLI becomes more intuitive and efficient, mirroring the interactivity of modern developer tools.

## Implementation Details
1. **Shell Integration:**
   - Develop autocompletion scripts for Bash, Zsh, and Fish. These scripts will be generated and installed either automatically or via an install command.
   - Provide a CLI flag (e.g., `--setup-autocomplete`) that outputs the necessary script details or installs them in the appropriate shell configuration directory.

2. **Context-Aware Suggestions:**
   - Integrate with the existing CLI parser to detect the current command segment (e.g., plot types, flags like `--advanced`, `--export-pdf`, etc.) and provide relevant suggestions.
   - Extend the numeric parameter validation logic to suggest correctly formatted tokens, including special cases like the literal 'NaN'.

3. **Documentation and Testing:**
   - Update the README and CONTRIBUTING documentation with instructions on how to enable and use autocompletion.
   - Develop unit and integration tests to ensure that the autocompletion responds appropriately, both in cases of partial input and full command structure.
   - Include troubleshooting steps for users facing issues with shell integration.

## Usage
- **Installation:**
  ```bash
  # For Bash users
  node src/lib/main.js --setup-autocomplete bash

  # For Zsh users
  node src/lib/main.js --setup-autocomplete zsh

  # For Fish users
  node src/lib/main.js --setup-autocomplete fish
  ```
- **Interactive Use:**
  - Once installed, users can type the plotting command and press the Tab key to receive suggestions for commands, flags, and parameters.
  - The autocompletion will dynamically update suggestions based on prior input, making the CLI more user-friendly and efficient.
