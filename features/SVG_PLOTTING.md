# SVG_PLOTTING

## Overview
This feature consolidates and enhances the existing SVG plot functionalities by merging gridlines support and advanced SVG customizations into a unified, robust plotting module. It supports publication-quality plots with optional gridlines, smooth curve rendering, dynamic color gradients, marker customization, and enhanced stroke styling including stroke width, dash arrays, and line cap options. Additionally, embedded plot metadata and accessibility support (ARIA labels and custom text anchoring) ensure a flexible and user-friendly experience.

## Implementation
- Merge the gridlines drawing logic into the main SVG plotting function.
- Extend the SVG rendering logic to include advanced customizations from both gridlines and enhanced stroke styling. Incorporate features such as:
  - Optional vertical and horizontal gridlines with customizable color, stroke width, and dash pattern
  - Stroke styling options: strokeWidth, strokeDashArray, and strokeLinecap (allowed values: butt, round, square)
  - Curve smoothing via quadratic Bezier curves with an adjustable smoothing factor
  - Dynamic gradient support with both simple color gradients and extended gradientStops configuration provided in JSON
  - Marker customization with options for markerStart and markerEnd, markerShape, markerWidth, markerHeight, and markerFill
  - Embedding plot metadata as a data attribute in the SVG to facilitate downstream processing and improve accessibility
  - Support for custom axis labels with adjustable precision, rotation, text anchor, and ARIA labels
- Update configuration handling and validation to accommodate the consolidated parameters. Ensure no existing functionality is lost, and maintain backward compatibility with the previous gridlines and SVG enhancements specifications.

## Impact
- Provides a unified, high-impact enhancement to the SVG plotting engine by consolidating similar features, reducing duplication and maintenance overhead.
- Elevates the publication-quality standard by combining grid-based reference systems and diverse styling options.
- Enhances accessibility, configurability, and precise visual control, thus directly increasing user satisfaction and adherence to the core mission.
