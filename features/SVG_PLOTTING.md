# Overview
This updated SVG_PLOTTING feature consolidates static plot generation, advanced styling, and dynamic animation capabilities into one unified module. It merges the previous SVG_ANIMATION functionality into the main SVG_PLOTTING module. In this update, users get publication-quality, customizable SVG plots that support optional animations, extended stroke styling (including strokeWidth, strokeDashArray, and strokeLinecap), marker customization, dynamic gradients, curve smoothing and adaptive axis labels, all with accessible and configurable metadata embedded in the output.

# Implementation
- Merge the previous SVG_ANIMATION logic into the main SVG_PLOTTING function. When the optional animate parameter is provided, the generated shape is wrapped with an embedded animate element that changes attributes such as stroke-dashoffset.
- Maintain advanced styling options by supporting custom stroke width, dash pattern, and line cap style for both polyline and smooth path outputs.
- Integrate marker support for both start and end markers with configurable shape, dimensions, and fill color.
- Ensure dynamic color gradient support, allowing both simple two-stop gradients and extended gradientStops provided as JSON arrays.
- Preserve all features for adaptive configuration: customizable dimensions, interactive axis labeling (with precision control, locale formatting, and ARIA accessibility attributes), and embedded plot metadata.
- Update configuration handling and tests in both CLI and HTTP modules to reflect the merged animation support within the SVG plotting functionality. All content is consolidated to maintain backward compatibility and reduce duplication across the code base.

# Impact
- Provides a unified plotting engine that supports both static and animated SVG visualizations, thereby increasing user engagement and enhancing the overall visual appeal.
- Reduces maintenance overhead by merging overlapping functionalities into a coherent feature set.
- Enhances usability, accessibility, and customization options, ensuring the library remains a go-to tool for plotting mathematical expressions with interactive features.
- Meets the repository mission by consolidating core plotting logic into a single, high-value feature that delivers measurable user impact.
