# Overview
This updated SVG_PLOTTING feature consolidates static plot generation, dynamic animations, advanced styling, marker customization, dynamic gradients, curve smoothing, and adaptive axis labeling into one unified module. In this update, accessibility enhancements have been incorporated to provide additional semantic information to screen readers by including optional <title> and <desc> elements in the generated SVG output.

# Implementation
- Merge previous SVG_ANIMATION functionality into the SVG_PLOTTING module so that when an optional animate parameter is provided, the generated shape is wrapped with an embedded animate element, enabling dynamic visual effects.
- Maintain advanced styling options by supporting custom stroke properties including strokeWidth, strokeDashArray, and strokeLinecap for polyline and smooth paths.
- Integrate marker support for both start and end markers with configurable shape, dimensions, and fill color via CLI or configuration file parameters.
- Enable dynamic gradient support. When the colorGradient option is enabled, if custom gradientStops are provided as a JSON array, generate extended multi-stop gradients; otherwise, fall back to simple two-stop gradients defined by gradientStartColor and gradientEndColor.
- Process plot data with adaptive resolution, mapping computed plot points to a dynamic SVG coordinate system determined by configurable width and height, with options for numeric precision and locale-specific formatting for axis labels.
- Enhance accessibility:
  - Introduce new CLI/configuration parameters (--svgTitle and --svgDesc) that allow users to specify a custom title and description for the SVG output.
  - When provided, insert a <title> element as the first child of the SVG and a subsequent <desc> element to describe the plot, improving screen reader compatibility.
  - If custom title or description are not provided, default values derived from the embedded metadata will be used.
  - Preserve existing ARIA attributes on text elements for axis labels to further support accessibility.
- Update the configuration merging logic and tests to reflect these accessibility additions along with the conventional plotting functionalities.

# Impact
- Unifies diverse plotting functionalities (static, animated, styled, and smoothed curves) into a single high-impact module.
- Provides extensive customization options for plot appearance such as dynamic color gradients, marker definitions, and stroke styling.
- Improves accessibility by incorporating semantic SVG elements (<title> and <desc>) that assist screen readers and enhance overall usability.
- Reduces maintenance overhead by consolidating configuration and plot generation logic, ensuring backward compatibility while extending functionality.
- Delivers measurable user impact by supporting both CLI and HTTP modes, aligning with the mission to be a go-to plot library for formula visualizations.
