# Overview
This update to the SVG_PLOTTING feature further enhances the unified module responsible for plot rendering. In addition to the existing functionalities such as static plot generation, dynamic animations, advanced styling including marker customization, dynamic gradients, curve smoothing, and adaptive axis labeling, this update introduces optional accessibility improvements. These improvements include the addition of <title> and <desc> elements into the SVG output when the corresponding CLI/configuration parameters are provided. This ensures that screen readers and other assistive technologies can interpret the visualizations more effectively.

# Implementation
- Retain prior functionalities such as CLI and HTTP mode plot generation, dynamic gradient support, marker customization (for both start and end), and advanced stroke styling (strokeWidth, strokeDashArray, strokeLinecap).
- Continue mapping computed plot data to a dynamic SVG coordinate system with configurable dimensions and adaptive resolution.
- Maintain existing enhancements for marker support, color gradients, curve smoothing and axis label formatting with optional locale-specific rendering.
- Enhance accessibility:
  - Introduce new CLI/configuration parameters (--svgTitle and --svgDesc) that allow users to specify a custom title and description for the SVG output.
  - When provided, inject a <title> element as the first child and a <desc> element immediately after into the generated SVG. These elements provide semantic context for screen readers, improving the overall accessibility of the plot.
  - Ensure that if no custom title or description is provided, default metadata derived from the plot configuration is used.
- Update unit and integration tests to verify that when the --svgTitle and --svgDesc parameters are provided, the generated SVG includes the corresponding <title> and <desc> elements in the correct order.
- Retain all other configuration merging and interpolation logic including environment variable support and robust error-handling for invalid parameters.

# Impact
- Improves accessibility significantly by providing semantic information to assistive technologies through embedded <title> and <desc> elements in the SVG output.
- Enhances user confidence by ensuring that plots generated via CLI or HTTP endpoints are compliant with accessibility best practices.
- Consolidates multiple advanced plotting capabilities into a single high-impact module while remaining backward compatible with existing configurations.
