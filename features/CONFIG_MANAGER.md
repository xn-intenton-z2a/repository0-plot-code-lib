# CONFIG_MANAGER Feature Specification (Enhanced with Remote Configuration)

## Overview
This feature provides a centralized configuration management module designed to streamline user preferences and default settings for the plotting library. It supports persistent defaults for plot styles, notification commands, unit preferences, and more. With the new enhancement, the module now also supports fetching remote configuration data from a configurable endpoint, allowing users to dynamically update defaults from a central server if desired.

## Implementation Details
- **Single Source File:** Implement as a dedicated module (e.g., `src/lib/configManager.js`) that handles the complete configuration lifecycle.

- **Configuration Storage and Retrieval:**
  - **Local Config:** Load and save configuration settings from a standard JSON file (e.g., `config.json`) in the userâ€™s environment, with support for environment variable overrides and secure defaults stored in the repository.
  - **Remote Config:** 
    - Optionally fetch configuration settings from a remote endpoint if a URL is provided via an environment variable (e.g., `REMOTE_CONFIG_URL`) or a CLI flag (e.g., `--remote-config-url`).
    - Merge the remote configuration with local settings, with the remote values providing updated defaults unless explicitly overridden by the user.
    - Cache remote configuration locally to minimize network calls and provide error recovery when the service is unavailable.

- **CLI Integration:**
  - Provide CLI flags such as `--show-config`, `--set-config <key>=<value>`, `--reset-config`, and an additional flag `--fetch-remote-config` to trigger an immediate fetch of remote configuration.
  - Integrate with the existing guided wizard to prompt users for configuration details, alerting them when remote defaults have been applied.

- **Validation and Fallbacks:**
  - Utilize libraries such as zod to validate configuration schemas ensuring that both local and remote inputs meet required standards.
  - Automatically revert to secure defaults when configuration is incomplete, invalid, or when remote fetch fails.

- **Library Integration:**
  - Allow programmatic access to configuration values for CLI operations, HTTP endpoints, and other repository modules, ensuring consistency across the tool.

## Testing and Documentation
- **Unit and Integration Tests:**
  - Develop tests to simulate local configuration loading, remote fetching, merging scenarios, and error handling.
  - Validate that configuration changes persist and properly reflect in the tool behavior.

- **Documentation Updates:**
  - Update README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md with usage examples and guidelines for both local and remote configuration management.
  - Provide troubleshooting guidelines for network issues and configuration validation errors.

## Benefits
- **Improved User Experience:** By centralizing both local and remote configuration, repetitive CLI input is reduced and configuration management becomes more dynamic.
- **Flexibility and Responsiveness:** Users can adjust defaults remotely, ensuring that the plotting tool is always aligned with the latest recommendations or organization standards.
- **Consistency:** Centralizing configuration handling across multiple input sources (local JSON, environment, remote endpoint) reduces errors and mismatches while maintaining secure defaults.

## Summary
The enhanced CONFIG_MANAGER feature centralizes configuration handling into a robust module. With the integration of remote configuration fetching and merging, users now benefit from dynamic, centrally updated defaults alongside persistent local settings, aligning seamlessly with our mission to be the go-to plot library for formula visualisations.
