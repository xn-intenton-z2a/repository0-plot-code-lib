# CONFIG_MANAGER Feature Specification

## Overview
This feature provides a centralized configuration management module designed to streamline user preferences and default settings for the plotting library. By managing configurations in a single repository component, users can set persistent defaults for plot styles, notification commands, unit preferences, and more—whether they use the tool via CLI or as a JS library.

## Implementation Details
- **Single Source File:** Implement as a dedicated module (e.g., `src/lib/configManager.js`) that handles the complete configuration lifecycle.
- **Configuration Storage:**
  - Load and save configuration settings from a standard JSON file (e.g., `config.json`) located in the user’s environment.
  - Support environment variable overrides and secure defaults stored in the repository.
- **CLI Integration:**
  - Provide new CLI flags (e.g., `--show-config`, `--set-config <key>=<value>`, `--reset-config`) to allow users to inspect and modify settings interactively.
  - Integrate with the existing guided wizard in the CLI to prompt users for configuration details if missing.
- **Validation and Fallbacks:**
  - Utilize libraries such as zod to validate configuration schemas, ensuring that user inputs meet required standards.
  - Offer automatic fallbacks to default settings when configurations are incomplete or invalid.
- **Library Integration:**
  - Allow programmatic access to configuration values for both CLI operations and API endpoints, promoting consistency across the tool.

## Testing and Documentation
- **Unit and Integration Tests:**
  - Develop tests to simulate configuration loading, updating, and error handling.
  - Validate that configuration changes persist and are correctly reflected in tool behavior.
- **Documentation Updates:**
  - Update README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md with usage examples and guidance on managing configurations.
  - Provide troubleshooting guidelines for issues related to configuration validation and file permissions.

## Benefits
- **Improved User Experience:** Eliminates repetitive CLI input by maintaining persistent settings.
- **Consistency:** Ensures that all components of the repository reference a centralized configuration, reducing errors and mismatches.
- **Flexibility:** Allows users to tailor the tool to their environment, enhancing both CLI and library usage.

## Summary
The CONFIG_MANAGER feature centralizes configuration handling into a single, robust module. It supports persistent defaults, interactive CLI management, and comprehensive validation, aligning seamlessly with our mission to be the go-to plot library for formula visualisations.
