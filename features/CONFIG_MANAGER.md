# CONFIG_MANAGER Feature Specification (Enhanced with Remote Configuration and Interactive Editor)

## Overview
This feature provides a centralized configuration management module that streamlines user preferences and default settings for the plotting library. It supports persistent defaults for plot styles, notification commands, unit preferences, and more. With recent enhancements, the module now fetches remote configuration data from a configurable endpoint and offers an interactive CLI-based configuration editor. This allows users to dynamically update settings and merge remote defaults with local configurations in a guided manner.

## Implementation Details
### Configuration Storage and Retrieval
- **Local Config:** Load and save settings from a standard JSON file (e.g., `config.json`) with support for environment variable overrides and secure defaults stored within the repository.
- **Remote Config:**
  - Optionally fetch configuration settings from a remote endpoint if a URL is provided via an environment variable (e.g., `REMOTE_CONFIG_URL`) or a CLI flag (e.g., `--remote-config-url`).
  - Merge remote configuration with local settings, using remote values as defaults unless explicitly overridden by the user.
  - Cache remote configuration locally to minimize network calls and provide error recovery when the remote service is unavailable.

### Interactive Configuration Editor
- **CLI Integration:**
  - Introduce a new CLI flag (e.g., `--edit-config`) to launch an interactive editor that guides users through current configuration settings.
  - Utilize Node.js' readline interface to prompt users with existing configuration values and allow inline modifications.
- **User Guidance:**
  - Present users with a step-by-step wizard to review, update, or reset configuration settings.
  - Provide inline help and validation (e.g., using zod for schema checks) during the editing process.
- **Persistence:**
  - Save user updates immediately to the local JSON config file.
  - Merge and prioritize remote configuration updates only if the user has not explicitly modified those values.

### CLI and Library Integration
- Provide additional CLI flags such as `--show-config`, `--set-config <key>=<value>`, `--reset-config`, and `--fetch-remote-config` to support configuration management from both command line and programmatic usage.
- Ensure the configuration values are accessible to other modules (e.g., PLOT_ENGINE, ACTIVITY_MANAGER) for consistent tool behavior.

## Testing and Documentation
- **Unit and Integration Tests:**
  - Simulate local configuration loading, remote fetching, merging scenarios, and interactive editing sessions.
  - Validate that configuration changes persist and reflect in the overall tool behavior.
- **Documentation Updates:**
  - Update README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md with usage examples and troubleshooting guidelines for both the automated and interactive configuration workflows.

## Benefits
- **Improved User Experience:** The interactive editor reduces repetitive CLI input and ensures configuration settings are easily updated, validated, and merged with remote defaults.
- **Flexibility and Responsiveness:** Dynamic remote configuration combined with immediate user feedback makes the plotting tool adaptive to evolving user and organizational preferences.
- **Consistency:** Centralized configuration handling minimizes errors and maintains secure defaults across various input sources.

## Summary
The enhanced CONFIG_MANAGER feature consolidates configuration handling into a single robust module. With integrated remote configuration fetching and an interactive CLI editor, users benefit from real-time guidance and dynamic updates of their settings, thus reinforcing our mission to be the go-to plot library for formula visualisations.
