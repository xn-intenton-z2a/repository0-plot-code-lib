# PLOT_DIAGNOSTICS Feature Specification

## Description
This feature introduces a diagnostic mode to the plotting library, providing detailed insights at every step of the plot generation process. When enabled (via a CLI flag like `--diagnostics` or through a dedicated option in the web interface), users receive verbose logging of numeric parameter validations, data processing steps, and rendering pipeline stages. This detailed output can include internal state snapshots, performance metrics, and intermediate outputs to help diagnose issues with complex formula-based visualizations.

## Motivation
- **Enhanced Debugging:** Empowers developers and advanced users to trace the execution flow and pinpoint errors or performance bottlenecks during plot generation.
- **Transparency:** Offers clear insights into how input parameters are parsed and processed, increasing user confidence when using advanced functionalities (like custom formulas and advanced plots).
- **Mission Alignment:** Reinforces our mission to be the go-to plot library by providing a powerful diagnostic tool that aids troubleshooting and continuous improvement, much like the debugging tools available in modern software development environments.

## Implementation Details
1. **CLI Integration:**
   - Introduce a new flag (e.g., `--diagnostics`) that activates detailed logging throughout the CLI execution.
   - Log each step including numeric validation results, parameter parsing outcomes, and intermediate render states.
   - Provide configurable verbosity levels (basic vs. advanced) to tailor the diagnostic output to the userâ€™s needs.

2. **Web Interface Integration:**
   - Implement a dedicated diagnostics panel or overlay that displays real-time logs and performance metrics during plot generation.
   - Allow users to toggle the diagnostics view on and off without disrupting the primary plotting interface.
   - Include visual indicators for timing information at key processing stages (e.g., data import, filtering, and rendering).

3. **Data and Performance Metrics:**
   - Capture timing and resource usage for each major stage in the plotting pipeline.
   - Optionally store diagnostic logs for later review, aiding in debugging persistent issues or performance anomalies.

4. **Testing and Configuration:**
   - Develop unit and integration tests to ensure that diagnostic information is accurately captured and reported, in both successful executions and error scenarios.
   - Update documentation and user guides to include instructions on how to activate and interpret the diagnostic output.

## Usage
- **CLI Example:**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --diagnostics "linear:column1,column2,-10,10,1"
  ```
- **Web Interface Example:**
   - Launch the web server with diagnostics enabled (e.g., via a settings toggle or a query parameter).
   - Navigate to the plotting interface and activate the diagnostics panel to view real-time processing logs and performance metrics.
