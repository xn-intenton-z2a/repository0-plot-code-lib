# REPORT_BUILDER Feature Specification

## Description
This feature introduces a comprehensive report building module to the plotting library. REPORT_BUILDER will allow users to combine multiple plots, summary statistics, and annotations into a single exportable document. By compiling individual visualizations, data analyses, and narrative comments, users can generate professional reports suitable for presentations, documentation, or sharing with stakeholders.

## Motivation
- **Integrated Reporting:** Users no longer need external tools to assemble multiple plots and statistical reports; the report builder streamlines the process by integrating report creation directly within the tool.
- **Enhanced Workflow:** By automating the assembly of plots and analyses, users can quickly generate end-to-end reports, saving time and reducing errors in manual compilation.
- **Mission Alignment:** Reinforcing our mission as the go-to plot library for formula-based visualisations, this feature extends the toolâ€™s utility from data visualization to comprehensive analytic reporting.

## Implementation Details
1. **Data and Plot Compilation:**
   - Allow users to select existing plots generated via the CLI or web interface, along with summary statistics, annotations, and custom text blocks.
   - Store report components temporarily in a structured format (e.g., JSON) to enable reordering and editing before finalization.

2. **Report Formatting:**
   - Support multiple output formats including PDF, HTML, and Markdown.
   - Leverage existing theming and customization options (such as custom themes and error bars) to ensure consistency in the final report presentation.

3. **User Interface Integration:**
   - For CLI users, introduce new flags (e.g., `--build-report` and `--report-config`) to specify report components and layout.
   - For web users, add a dedicated report builder panel where components can be dragged, dropped, and previewed in real-time.

4. **Editing and Exporting:**
   - Provide interactive editing features to adjust the layout, add headings, and include narrative text.
   - Integrate export functionalities that allow users to save the report as a single file or share it via common platforms (email, cloud storage, etc.).

## Usage
- **CLI Example:**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --build-report report.json --export-pdf finalReport.pdf
  ```
  *(In the above command, `report.json` contains the specification of plots, stats, and layout details.)*

- **Web Interface Example:**
   - Launch the web server with `npm run start:web`.
   - Navigate to the report builder section, drag and drop desired plots and summaries, adjust layout interactively, and click "Export" to generate a final report in the desired format.
