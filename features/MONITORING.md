# MONITORING Feature Specification (Enhanced with Usage Metrics and Error Logging)

## Overview
This feature consolidates error logging and usage telemetry into a single, unified module. It is designed to capture runtime errors across the CLI, HTTP endpoints, and background tasks while also collecting usage metrics such as command frequency, performance timings, and plot generation statistics. By merging these capabilities, we improve both diagnostic capabilities and provide actionable insights for performance optimizations. This alignment of error and performance monitoring supports our mission to be the go-to plot library for formula visualisations.

## Implementation Details
- **Single Source File:** Implement as a dedicated module (e.g., `src/lib/monitoring.js`) which replaces the existing `ERROR_LOGGER`.
- **Error Logging:**
  - Capture errors, warnings, and informational events from CLI commands, HTTP endpoints, scheduled tasks, and core plotting operations.
  - Support logging to a local file (e.g., `logs/error.log`) with log rotation and optional integration with external logging endpoints configured via environment variables.
  
- **Usage Telemetry:**
  - Collect usage data including frequency of CLI command invocation, performance metrics (e.g., plot generation durations, cache hits/misses), and overall operational statistics.
  - Log telemetry data to a dedicated file (e.g., `logs/usage.log`) and optionally forward summaries to an external monitoring service.
  
- **CLI Integration:**
  - Provide CLI flags such as `--view-logs` to display recent error logs and `--usage-stats` to output current telemetry metrics.
  - Integrate with the existing CLI interface to ensure that usage tracking does not affect performance.

- **Validation and Configuration:**
  - Use libraries like zod to validate both error log formats and telemetry data ensuring consistency.
  - Enable configuration of log levels and telemetry granularity via JSON configuration files or environment variables.

## Testing and Documentation
- **Unit and Integration Tests:**
  - Develop tests that simulate error events and record corresponding logs.
  - Validate the accuracy and completeness of usage metrics collection under various scenarios.
- **Documentation Updates:**
  - Update README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md with usage examples for both error logging and telemetry functionalities.
  - Include troubleshooting guidelines and configuration examples for both local and external telemetry integrations.

## Benefits
- **Centralized Monitoring:** Combines error logging and usage telemetry into a single cohesive system, reducing maintenance overhead and improving diagnostic efficiency.
- **Actionable Insights:** Provides detailed insights into system performance and user behavior, aiding in performance tuning and proactive maintenance.
- **Enhanced Reliability:** Facilitates quick identification and resolution of issues while enabling continuous system improvement based on real usage statistics.

## Summary
The updated MONITORING feature replaces the traditional ERROR_LOGGER by integrating comprehensive error logging with robust usage telemetry. This dual approach not only enhances reliability but also delivers vital insights into the operational efficiency of the plotting library, aligning closely with the projectâ€™s mission of being an indispensable tool for formula visualisations.
