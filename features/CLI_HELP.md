# CLI_HELP Feature

## Overview

This feature adds an interactive, comprehensive help system to the CLI. It aims to guide users by providing detailed usage instructions, illustrative examples, and error troubleshooting tips, making the tool more accessible and user-friendly. The help system will display guidance on parameter formats, available plot types, and custom error handling through clear, contextual messaging.

## Implementation Details

- **Help Trigger:** Implement a flag (e.g., `--help`) and detect absence of arguments to trigger the help output.
- **Usage Instructions:** Display usage examples that cover both colon-separated and advanced JSON configuration modes, including examples of valid numeric input and custom NaN aliases.
- **Error Guidance:** When invalid inputs are detected, instead of abruptly exiting, provide recommendations by suggesting accepted formats and linking to the README and CONTRIBUTING guides.
- **Integration:** Add the help functionality within the main module (`src/lib/main.js`), leveraging existing logic to detail plot types and parameter formatting.
- **Testing:** Write unit tests to verify that the help message is correctly displayed, does not trigger process termination, and that the output remains consistent with the documentation.

## Integration and Testing

- **CLI Integration:** Modify the main function to check for `--help` or missing arguments and display the help message accordingly.
- **Unit Tests:** Create tests that confirm the correct help message is output when invoked. Ensure that when help is requested, the program does not proceed with plotting or error exits.
- **Documentation Sync:** Ensure that the help message aligns with the instructions available in README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md.

## Benefits

- **Enhanced User Experience:** New and experienced users can quickly understand how to use the CLI, reducing the learning curve.
- **Reduced Support Overhead:** Clear in-app guidance minimizes ambiguity and potential errors in command usage.
- **Alignment with Mission:** Supports the mission of being the go-to plot library by providing clear, accessible tools to interact with advanced plotting features.

## Future Opportunities

- **Localization:** Expand help messages to support multiple languages or locale-specific instructions.
- **Interactive Mode:** Consider an interactive help mode that guides users step-by-step through generating complex plot commands.
