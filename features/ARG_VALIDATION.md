# ARG_VALIDATION Feature Specification

## Overview
This feature introduces robust argument validation for the CLI interface using the Zod library. It enforces strict schema validation for user inputs, ensuring that all command parameters adhere to expected formats and values. This addition minimizes runtime errors caused by malformed inputs and improves user experience with detailed error messages and guidance.

## Implementation Details
- **Zod Schema Definition:**
  - Define Zod schemas for various CLI commands and flags (e.g., --plot, --history, --unit flags, --wizard, etc.).
  - Validate input types and ranges (e.g., numeric ranges for intervals, valid unit strings, and proper list formats for tags).

- **Integration with CLI Parsing:**
  - Integrate the Zod-based validators into the main CLI processing in `src/lib/main.js`.
  - Before dispatching commands to their respective handlers, run compliance checks against the defined schemas.
  - Upon validation failure, provide clear and actionable error messages that suggest correct usage.

- **Error Handling and Documentation:**
  - Log validation errors in a consistent format that aligns with existing logging and diagnostics features.
  - Update documentation (README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md) with usage examples highlighting common pitfalls and corrected patterns.
  - Include unit tests to cover various valid and invalid input scenarios to ensure robustness.

## Benefits
- **User Guidance:**
  - Enhanced error feedback reduces user confusion and facilitates rapid correction of command-line input errors.
- **Reliability:**
  - Ensures compliance with expected input parameters, reducing runtime exceptions and unpredictable behaviors.
- **Maintainability:**
  - Centralized validation logic improves code clarity and simplifies future enhancements to input specification.
