# DATA_PROCESSING Feature Specification

## Description
This feature consolidates data ingestion and statistical analysis into a single cohesive module. It merges the functionalities of importing data files (CSV and JSON) and computing summary statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation, quartiles, etc.) on the datasets. Users can seamlessly load external datasets and immediately gain insights through automatically computed statistics, which can be used to augment plot visualizations or serve as a standalone analytical report.

## Motivation
- **Seamless Data Integration:** Combine raw data file import and analytical summaries in one module to reduce complexity and streamline workflows.
- **Enhanced Insight:** By coupling data import with on-the-fly statistical analysis, users receive instant feedback on the datasets, aiding in quicker decision-making and error detection.
- **Mission Alignment:** This consolidation supports our mission to be the go-to plot library by simplifying data preparation and embedding analytics directly within the plotting workflow.

## Implementation Details
1. **Data Importation:**
   - Implement a unified CLI flag (e.g., `--import <filePath>`) to support both CSV and JSON formats.
   - Automatically detect file types based on file extension and parse content into a structured format.
   - Validate input data to ensure suitability for subsequent plotting and analysis.

2. **Statistical Analysis:**
   - Integrate with a statistical library (e.g., mathjs) to compute summary statistics such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, quartiles, and range.
   - Provide options via an additional CLI flag (e.g., `--stats [overlay|console|export]`) to display statistics as overlays on plots, print them to the console, or output them to a file (JSON/Markdown).
   - Ensure graceful handling of non-numeric or missing data with clear error messages.

3. **CLI and Web Interface Support:**
   - Update the CLI to accept combined flags for data import and stats calculation in a single command.
   - In the web interface, add a panel within the data submission or plotting configuration to preview imported data along with live updated statistical summaries.

4. **Testing and Documentation:**
   - Develop comprehensive unit and integration tests to cover both data parsing and statistical computations.
   - Update the README and CONTRIBUTING documentation with detailed usage examples and troubleshooting guidelines.

## Usage
- **CLI Example:**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --import data.csv --plot "linear:column1,column2,-10,10,1" --stats overlay
  ```

- **Web Interface Example:**
   - Start the web server with `npm run start:web`.
   - Use the data import panel to load a dataset and toggle the statistics overlay to view the computed summary metrics in real time.
