# Overview
This feature enhances the generated SVG plots by adding clearly labeled axes to improve interpretability and user experience. The X and Y axis labels provide context for the plotted data and help users understand the scale and values represented in the plot.

# Implementation
- Modify the createSvgPlot function in the source file to include additional SVG text elements for the X and Y axes.
- Position the X-axis label at the bottom-center of the SVG, and the Y-axis label along the left side, rotated appropriately.
- Ensure that these labels do not interfere with the original plot annotation text and the blue polyline displaying the curve.
- Update the README and usage documentation with a note on the enhanced visual output, detailing the presence of axis labels in the generated SVG.
- Adjust tests minimally to verify that the SVG now includes these additional label elements while preserving the existing validations (e.g., ensuring the plot still contains a polyline and basic text annotation).

# Impact
With the inclusion of clearly defined X and Y axis labels, users will have an improved understanding of the data scale and context, leading to better interpretability of the plots. This change delivers a core usability enhancement without altering the core functionality, making the tool more useful and visually informative.
