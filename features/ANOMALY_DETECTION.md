# ANOMALY_DETECTION Feature Specification

## Description
This feature introduces anomaly detection capabilities to the plotting library. It automatically identifies outliers and unusual patterns within datasets and highlights them in the visualizations. By flagging potential data anomalies, users can quickly pinpoint errors, outliers, or data points that deviate significantly from expected trends.

## Motivation
- **Data Quality Assurance:** Provides insights into potential anomalies that may affect the reliability of the analysis.
- **Enhanced Analysis:** Automatically flagged outliers improve the clarity of visualizations by drawing attention to data points that warrant further investigation.
- **Mission Alignment:** Reinforces our mission to be the go-to plot library by integrating advanced analytical tools that extend basic plotting capabilities and support data-driven decision-making.

## Implementation Details
1. **Data Processing Integration:**
   - Leverage the existing data import and filtering pipeline to access numerical datasets.
   - Apply robust statistical methods, such as standard deviation thresholds or interquartile range (IQR) analysis, to detect anomalies.
   - Allow customization of the detection sensitivity via CLI flags (e.g., `--anomaly-threshold`) or configuration settings.

2. **Visualization Enhancements:**
   - Overlay distinct markers or use color-coding schemes to visually highlight detected anomalies in plots (e.g., in scatter or line plots).
   - In the web interface, integrate tooltips or interactive annotations that display additional details for each flagged anomaly (e.g., deviation magnitude, statistical significance).

3. **Configuration and Customization:**
   - Provide options for users to adjust parameters for anomaly detection, such as threshold levels, via both CLI and web interface configuration panels.
   - Integrate error handling to manage datasets with insufficient data or extreme values, providing clear feedback to users.

4. **Testing and Documentation:**
   - Develop comprehensive unit and integration tests to ensure anomaly detection works correctly across various datasets and edge cases.
   - Update the README and CONTRIBUTING documentation with detailed examples, usage guidelines, and troubleshooting tips for the anomaly detection feature.

## Usage
- **CLI Example:**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --import data.csv --plot "line:column1,column2,-10,10,1" --anomaly-detect --anomaly-threshold 2.5
  ```
- **Web Interface Example:**
   - Launch the web server and navigate to the plotting dashboard.
   - Enable the anomaly detection option, adjust the sensitivity settings through a slider or input field, and view the highlighted outliers directly on the interactive plot.
