# PLOT RENDERING

## Overview
This feature consolidates enhancements to plotting into a single, unified endpoint. It merges the improvements from dynamic SVG axis labeling with robust response handling that supports SVG, PNG, and JSON outputs. The unified endpoint will deliver enhanced plot rendering with detailed validations and customizable styling through query parameters. This consolidation streamlines the codebase and strengthens the core functionality of the library.

## Implementation
- Integrate dynamic SVG enhancements: add clearly labeled X and Y axes with customizable options (font size, color, rotation, offset, and locale-aware formatting).
- Merge JSON export and SVG/PNG rendering by unifying the /plot endpoint. When a JSON response is requested, the endpoint will compute and return an array of 100 data point objects along with the input expression and range. For SVG and PNG responses, maintain the advanced axis labeling and visual rendering.
- Ensure that all input validations for mathematical expressions, numeric ranges, and custom label parameters are consolidated. Provide comprehensive aggregated error feedback when multiple validations fail.
- Update documentation and tests to reflect these combined enhancements, ensuring seamless integration and backward compatibility with existing usage patterns.

## Testing
- Extend existing unit tests to verify that the unified endpoint returns the correct response format based on the Accept header and query parameters.
- Validate that dynamic axis labels appear correctly with all customizations, including rotation, offsets, and locale-specific formatting.
- Confirm that the JSON export includes accurately computed time series data and that error handling remains robust for all input validations.

## Impact
This merged feature enhances the library's core capability by providing a single authoritative endpoint for plot rendering and data export. It simplifies maintenance, reduces redundancy, and improves the user experience by delivering high-impact, comprehensive plotting functionality aligned with the mission of being a go-to plot library.
