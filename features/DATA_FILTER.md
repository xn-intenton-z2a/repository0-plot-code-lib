# DATA_FILTER Feature Specification

## Description
This feature introduces data filtering capabilities to the plotting library. It enables users to apply custom filter expressions to datasets prior to visualization. By integrating this functionality, users can isolate subsets of data that meet specific conditions, transforming raw data into meaningful plots without relying on external tools. This aligns with our mission of being the jq of formulae visualisations by embedding powerful, inline data querying and transformation capabilities.

## Motivation
- **Enhanced Data Processing:** Empower users to refine and manipulate imported data directly within the tool, reducing the need for additional preprocessing steps.
- **Streamlined Workflows:** Combine data import, filtering, and plotting in a single command-line or web-based operation for a more efficient visualization pipeline.
- **Mission Alignment:** By incorporating filtering functionalities reminiscent of the jq tool for JSON, this feature reinforces our commitment to providing comprehensive, formula-based visualisation tools.

## Implementation Details
1. **CLI Integration:**
   - Introduce a new CLI flag (e.g., `--filter`) to accept simple filter expressions.
   - Allow users to provide the filter expression inline or reference a file containing the expression.
   - Parse and validate the filter expression to ensure it follows an acceptable syntax, such as basic comparisons (e.g., `column1>5` or `column2<=10`).

2. **Data Processing Pipeline:**
   - Integrate the filtering step into the existing data import workflow to allow seamless chaining of `DATA_IMPORT` and `DATA_FILTER` functionalities.
   - Leverage existing libraries (such as mathjs) to evaluate the filter expression against each row of data. For example, evaluate if a row meets the condition and include only matching rows for plotting.
   - Ensure robust error handling and user-friendly messages if the filter expression is malformed or if no data meets the criteria.

3. **Web Interface Integration:**
   - Add a user interface component on the web front-end for inputting filter expressions.
   - Provide real-time feedback by previewing the filtered dataset before plot rendering.
   - Include explanatory tooltips and documentation on acceptable expression syntax and examples.

4. **Testing and Documentation:**
   - Extend unit and integration tests to cover various filter expressions, ensuring compatibility with both CSV and JSON data imports.
   - Update the README and CONTRIBUTING documentation with usage examples, including typical command-line invocations and web interface demonstrations. For example:
     ```bash
     node src/lib/main.js --import data.csv --filter "column1>5" --plot "linear:column1,column2,-10,10,1"
     ```
   - Ensure error cases (e.g., syntax errors or no matching data) are thoroughly tested and documented.

## Usage
- **CLI Example:**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --import data.json --filter "age>=30" --plot "bar:age,salary"
  ```
- **Web Interface Example:**
  - Navigate to the web interface, upload or select a dataset, enter a filter expression in the designated field, and preview the resulting data before generating the corresponding plot.

This feature will provide a significant enhancement by enabling in-tool data refinement, making our plotting library even more versatile and in line with the mission to serve as the go-to tool for advanced data visualisations.
