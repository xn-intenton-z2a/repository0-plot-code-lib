# FILE_WATCHER Feature Specification

## Overview
This feature introduces a file watching capability to automatically regenerate plots whenever source files, data files, or configuration files are updated. By integrating real-time monitoring into the CLI, users can work in a live, feedback-driven mode that keeps visualisations in sync with current data. This aligns with our mission to be the go-to plot library by reducing manual re-runs and boosting overall productivity.

## Implementation Details
- **File Monitoring:**
  - Uses Node.js's built-in fs.watch API to monitor specified files or directories for changes.
  - Provides a new CLI flag (`--watch <path>`) for users to define the file or directory to be watched.
  - Implements a debounce mechanism to prevent excessive re-triggering on rapid file changes.

- **Automatic Plot Regeneration:**
  - On detecting changes, automatically invokes the underlying PLOT_ENGINE to refresh plots based on updated data or configuration.
  - Integrates with existing logging in ACTIVITY_MANAGER to record file change events and plot regeneration actions.

- **CLI Integration & User Guidance:**
  - Enhances the CLI with clear status messages during live monitoring, displaying notifications when files change and plots are updated.
  - Offers inline help and usage documentation via the `--help` flag for the file watching functionality.

- **Resilience and Error Handling:**
  - Includes error recovery for issues like file access problems or invalid paths.
  - Logs errors and warning messages consistently, ensuring that users can troubleshoot if the watcher encounters issues.

## Testing and Documentation
- **Unit and Integration Tests:**
  - Simulate file modifications to ensure that the watcher detects changes and triggers plot regeneration appropriately.
  - Validate the debounce logic and error handling when monitoring various file types and directories.

- **Documentation Updates:**
  - Update README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md with detailed usage examples and configuration settings for the file watcher mode.
  - Clearly explain expected behavior, configuration options, and troubleshooting steps in the documentation.

## Benefits
- **Efficiency:** Automatically updates plots as source files change, reducing the need for manual intervention and re-running commands.
- **Enhanced User Experience:** Provides real-time visual feedback, ensuring that users always interact with the most current data output.
- **Seamless Integration:** Leverages existing modules (PLOT_ENGINE and ACTIVITY_MANAGER) for consistent behaviour and logging without adding significant overhead.

## Summary
The FILE_WATCHER feature adds live monitoring to the plotting library, triggering automatic plot regeneration upon file changes. This streamlined approach reinforces our commitment to user-friendly, real-time visualisation, making it a valuable addition to our repository.
