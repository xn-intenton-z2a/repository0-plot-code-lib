# SVG_OPTIMIZATION Feature Specification

## Description
This feature introduces advanced SVG optimization capabilities into the plotting library. It aims to reduce file sizes and improve rendering performance by cleaning up, compressing, and streamlining the generated SVG outputs. By minimizing redundant metadata, optimizing path data, and simplifying style definitions, the tool will produce leaner and more efficient SVG files that are ideal for high-performance web applications and rapid visualization workflows.

## Motivation
- **Performance Improvement:** Optimized SVG files load faster and render more smoothly in browsers and other SVG-capable environments.
- **File Size Reduction:** Smaller file sizes lead to quicker downloads, reduced storage requirements, and better performance when generating numerous plots.
- **Enhanced Interactivity:** A more streamlined SVG structure allows for better support of interactive features such as zooming and panning.
- **Mission Alignment:** This feature supports our mission to be the go-to plot library by enhancing the technical efficiency and usability of its visual outputs, ensuring that our advanced formula-based visualizations are both high quality and performant.

## Implementation Details
1. **Integration with the Rendering Pipeline:**
   - Add a post-processing step after plot rendering which runs an SVG optimization routine. This can be implemented using a library such as SVGO or a custom lightweight optimizer.
   - Ensure that the optimization process preserves all critical visual elements and interactivity features.

2. **CLI Integration:**
   - Introduce a new CLI flag (e.g., `--optimize-svg`) that activates the SVG optimization process.
   - Allow users to specify additional parameters for optimization (such as optimization level or excluding specific elements) via CLI options.

3. **Web Interface Support:**
   - Add an option in the export settings of the web interface to toggle SVG optimization on or off.
   - Provide a preview of the optimized SVG to help users understand the impact of optimization on visual quality and file size.

4. **Customization and Testing:**
   - Allow configuration of default optimization settings through configuration files or user profiles.
   - Develop comprehensive unit and integration tests to validate that SVG outputs maintain visual integrity while achieving reduced file sizes.
   - Benchmark the performance improvements and file size reduction compared to unoptimized SVG outputs.

## Usage
- **CLI Example:**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --import data.csv --plot "linear:column1,column2,-10,10,1" --optimize-svg output.svg
  ```

- **Web Interface Example:**
   - Launch the web server using `npm run start:web`.
   - Navigate to the export settings panel and enable the SVG optimization toggle before exporting your plot.
