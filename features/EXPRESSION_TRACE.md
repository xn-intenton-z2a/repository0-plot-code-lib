# EXPRESSION_TRACE Feature Specification

## Overview
This feature adds an optional detailed trace mode for mathematical expression evaluation within the plotting library. When enabled via a CLI flag (e.g., `--trace`), the system will output a step-by-step breakdown of the computation process. This includes parsing the expression, performing unit conversions, intermediate calculations, caching decisions, and final plot data generation. This mode will benefit users who want to understand the inner workings of the formula evaluation process or debug unexpected plot outcomes.

## Implementation Details
- **CLI Integration:** 
  - Introduce a new flag (`--trace`) that when set, activates tracing in both CLI and library API contexts.
  - The trace output is printed to the console or logged to a file, as per user configuration.

- **Trace Generation:**
  - Intercept key stages of the calculation process within the PLOT_ENGINE. 
  - Output detailed information including the parsed token list, intermediate numeric results, and any unit conversion actions.
  - Optionally, expose the trace details through an HTTP API endpoint (e.g., `GET /trace?formula=<formula>`) for remote inspection in development environments.

- **Safe Mode and Performance:**
  - Ensure tracing can be enabled without affecting the core evaluation performance in production environments, using conditional logging.
  - Offer a toggle to limit trace detail level (e.g., basic vs. verbose) to control output size.

## Testing and Documentation
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Create test cases that verify the correctness and completeness of the trace output for a variety of formulas, including edge cases, invalid inputs, and unit conversion scenarios.
  - Ensure that enabling/disabling the trace mode does not interfere with the main plotting functionality.

- **Documentation:**
  - Update the README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md to include usage examples and troubleshooting tips related to the trace mode.
  - Provide inline code comments and a separate developer guide section documenting the tracing mechanism and its integration points.

## Benefits
- **Transparency:** Provides users and developers with clear insights into the complex evaluation process, increasing confidence in plot accuracy.
- **Debugging:** Helps in quickly identifying and resolving issues in formula parsing and computation, especially in custom function or unit conversion scenarios.
- **Educational Value:** Acts as an educational tool by exposing the intermediate steps involved in generating plots, which is useful for learning and advanced usage.

## Summary
The EXPRESSION_TRACE feature enhances the plotting library by offering a transparent view of the computation pipeline. This not only aids debugging and troubleshooting but also aligns with our mission to be the go-to resource for formula visualisations by making the process more understandable and robust.
