# SUBPLOTTING Feature Specification

## Description
This feature introduces the capability to generate multi-panel or composite plots within the plotting library. Users will be able to combine several individual plots into a single coherent visualization, arranging them in a grid or custom layout. This will enable side-by-side comparisons, dashboard-style visualizations, and enhanced data storytelling all within one command-line or web interface session.

## Motivation
- **Enhanced Comparative Analysis:** Users can view multiple related plots simultaneously to better understand correlations or differences between datasets.
- **Dashboard and Reporting:** Facilitates the creation of comprehensive visual reports, ideal for presentations and exploratory data analysis.
- **Mission Alignment:** Extends our mission by making the plotting tool more versatile and the go-to library for creating detailed, formula-based visualizations.

## Implementation Details
1. **CLI Integration:**
   - Introduce a new CLI flag, e.g., `--subplot`, to activate multi-panel plotting mode.
   - Allow users to specify sub-commands or parameters indicating the layout (e.g., number of rows and columns) and assign individual plot configurations to each panel.
   
2. **Data and Input Management:**
   - Reuse existing data import, filtering, and validation logic to handle inputs for each subplot.
   - Provide mechanisms for users to separate parameters for different subplots, potentially using a delimiter (e.g., `|` or a new flag).

3. **Rendering Engine Enhancements:**
   - Modify the rendering pipeline to aggregate multiple plot outputs into a single output file.
   - Support both static (SVG, PNG) and text-based (ASCII) outputs, ensuring that the composite plot maintains clarity and consistency across formats.

4. **Web Interface Update:**
   - Extend the web interface to include options for selecting and arranging multiple plots in a custom layout.
   - Provide real-time previews of the subplot arrangement, allowing users to adjust the layout interactively.

5. **Testing and Documentation:**
   - Add unit tests for parsing subplot-specific arguments and ensuring correct composition of multiple plots.
   - Update the README and CONTRIBUTING documentation with examples and usage guidelines for multi-panel plotting.

## Usage
- **CLI Example:**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --subplot "rows:2,cols:2" "linear:1,2,3,4" | "sine:1,0,0,360,1" | "bar:10,20,30,40" | "scatter:1,2;3,4;5,6"
  ```
- **Web Interface Example:**
   - Launch the web server and navigate to the subplot section, where you can drag and drop plot modules into a grid layout and adjust the number of rows and columns interactively.

This SUBPLOTTING feature enhances the plotting library by enabling comprehensive visual summaries and multi-faceted analyses in a single, cohesive output.
