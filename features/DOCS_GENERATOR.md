# DOCS_GENERATOR Feature Specification

## Overview
This feature introduces an automated documentation generator that extracts inline code comments, usage examples, and test descriptions to produce updated Markdown documentation. The tool is designed to streamline maintenance by ensuring that README, CONTRIBUTING, and other reference documents remain current with source code changes. By linking documentation directly to code, the repository can enhance user onboarding and developer contributions in alignment with our mission.

## Implementation Details
- **Source File:** A single source file (e.g., `src/lib/docsGenerator.js`) will be created to implement documentation extraction and formatting.
- **CLI Integration:** A new CLI flag (e.g., `--generate-docs`) will trigger the documentation generation process, making it possible to update documentation as part of the build or development pipeline.
- **Parsing Strategy:** Utilize JavaScript's built-in file system and regex capabilities to extract structured comments (following JSDoc or custom markdown annotations) from source files and test files.
- **Output Generation:** Generate Markdown files including a refreshed README, updated CONTRIBUTING guidelines, and inline code documentation that can be merged into existing developer resources.
- **Customization:** Provide configuration options (via a JSON config file or CLI flags) to customize which files and comment patterns to include.

## Testing and Documentation
- **Unit Tests:** Include tests to validate that comments are correctly extracted from a variety of source files and that Markdown formatting is applied consistently.
- **Integration:** Ensure that documentation updates do not break existing workflows and that generated files are correctly referenced in the repository.
- **Documentation:** Update the CONTRIBUTING.md file with guidelines on how to use and extend the DOCS_GENERATOR feature. Include examples of in-code annotations and the expected generated output.

## Benefits
- **Consistency:** Automatically synchronizes documentation with code, reducing the risk of outdated instructions.
- **Efficiency:** Streamlines developer workflow by reducing manual overhead in updating docs, thus allowing focus on code improvements.
- **Transparency:** Provides a clear, auto-generated view of code functionality and test coverage available to all contributors.
- **Mission Alignment:** Supports our mission by ensuring that the repository remains a reliable and user-friendly resource for plotting and formula visualisations.

## Summary
The DOCS_GENERATOR feature empowers developers to maintain high-quality, up-to-date documentation with minimal effort. By integrating documentation generation into the repositoryâ€™s workflow, we improve both user experience and contribution quality, ensuring that the project stays aligned with our mission of being the go-to plot library for formula visualisations.
