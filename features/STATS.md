# STATS Feature Enhancement

This update fully integrates the `--stats` flag into the CLI tool. When enabled, the tool will compute and display basic statistics for each mathematical expressionâ€™s computed y-values. This includes the minimum, maximum, and average values. This enhancement provides immediate insights to users on the data generated by their expressions, supporting the mission of being a go-to tool for formula visualisations.

## CLI Parameter Parsing & Validation

- Extend the CLI schema in `src/lib/main.js` to include a new optional boolean parameter `stats`. For example, add:

  ```js
  stats: z.boolean().optional()
  ```

- Update the argument parsing logic to recognize the `--stats` flag.

## Implementation Details

- After evaluating the y-values for each expression and populating `yValuesArray`, check if the `stats` flag is active.
- For each set of y-values, compute:
  - **Minimum Value:** using `Math.min(...yValues)`
  - **Maximum Value:** using `Math.max(...yValues)`
  - **Average Value:** by summing the values and dividing by the count.
- Output the computed statistics to the console, formatted with clear labels for each expression. This statistics output should be printed before proceeding to export or plotting routines.

## Testing Enhancements

- Update the test suite in `tests/unit/main.test.js` to include tests that verify the following:
  - When the `--stats` flag is provided, the console output includes a statistics summary for each expression.
  - The statistics are correctly computed and formatted, even when multiple expressions are provided.

## Documentation Updates

- Update the `README.md` to document the new `--stats` flag. Explain that when this flag is enabled, the CLI prints summary statistics (min, max, average) for computed y-values.

## Dependency and Build Consistency

- No new dependencies are required. The changes remain fully compatible with Node 20 and ECMAScript modules.
- Ensure that these modifications conform to the guidelines outlined in `CONTRIBUTING.md` and reflect the mission in `MISSION.md`.
