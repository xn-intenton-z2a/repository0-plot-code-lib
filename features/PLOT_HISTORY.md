# PLOT_HISTORY Feature Specification

## Overview
The PLOT_HISTORY feature introduces a lightweight mechanism to persist user plot interactions. It records key parameters and inputs used in plot generation, enabling users to review, reuse, and manage their previous plotting commands. This aligns with our mission by enhancing the usability of the plotting library and providing an effective way to track and reproduce visualizations.

## Implementation Details
- **History Logging:**
  - Automatically record details (formula, interval, step, and optional flags like color or export paths) whenever a plot is generated via the CLI.
  - Append the data as JSON entries to a local file (e.g., `history.json`).
- **CLI Commands:**
  - Introduce a `--history` flag to display the list of previous plot commands with timestamps and parameters.
  - Introduce a `--clear-history` flag to allow users to remove the existing history for a fresh start.
- **File Handling:**
  - Ensure robust file I/O operations with error handling for cases such as missing permissions or file corruption.
  - Use asynchronous file system APIs to avoid blocking operations during history recording.

## Testing and Documentation
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Develop tests to simulate recording plot commands and validate that the `history.json` file is updated correctly.
  - Create tests for the `--history` and `--clear-history` commands to ensure accurate retrieval and deletion of history records.
- **Documentation Updates:**
  - Update the README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md files with usage examples for the history commands.
  - Provide clear guidelines on how the history feature improves reproducibility and usability for both developers and end-users.

## Usage Examples
- **Recording a Plot:**
  - Run a plot command such as `node src/lib/main.js --plot "sin(x)" --color` and the parameters are automatically saved.
- **Viewing History:**
  - Run `node src/lib/main.js --history` to display the stored plot commands along with details and timestamps.
- **Clearing History:**
  - Run `node src/lib/main.js --clear-history` to remove all existing records from the history file.
