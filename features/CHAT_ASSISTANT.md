# CHAT_ASSISTANT Feature Specification

## Overview
The CHAT_ASSISTANT feature introduces an interactive, AI-powered support layer to our plotting library. Leveraging the OpenAI API, this feature provides real-time, natural language assistance for configuration guidance, troubleshooting, and usage tips. The assistant is accessible via the CLI and can also be integrated into the HTTP API, ensuring that both command-line users and remote clients can benefit from contextual help and insights.

## Implementation Details
- **Integration with OpenAI:**
  - Utilize the `openai` package to process user queries and generate helpful responses based on the repositoryâ€™s documentation and in-app context.
  - Implement fallbacks for error handling and network disruptions, ensuring a robust user experience even when the remote API is unavailable.
- **Query Processing:**
  - Process user input from a dedicated chat interface and map it to common troubleshooting scenarios (e.g., configuration missteps, usage examples, and error interpretations).
  - Cache frequent queries to reduce API calls and improve performance.
- **Seamless Merging:**
  - To maintain a manageable feature set, the scheduling and live file monitoring aspects (currently divided into SCHEDULED_PLOTTING and FILE_WATCHER) will be merged into a consolidated **AUTOMATION** feature. This consolidation frees up space for the new CHAT_ASSISTANT feature while ensuring continuity of core automation workflows.

## CLI and API Integration
- **CLI Flag:** Introduce a new terminal flag (e.g., `--chat`) to initiate an interactive chat session directly in the terminal. The chat session offers suggestions, interprets natural language commands, and guides users towards the appropriate usage patterns.
- **HTTP Endpoint:** Optionally expose an endpoint (e.g., `/chat`) as part of the unified CLI_API feature. This endpoint will mirror the CLI chat functionality for remote clients.
- **User Guidance:** Embed inline help, usage examples, and dynamic responses that correlate with commands executed in the plotting library.

## Testing and Documentation
- **Unit & Integration Tests:** Develop tests that simulate various chat queries, validate connectivity to the OpenAI API, and ensure that fallback mechanisms work as expected.
- **Documentation Updates:** Update the README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md files to include usage examples, troubleshooting tips, and integration instructions for both CLI and HTTP API contexts. Provide clear examples of how to initiate and use the chat assistant feature.

## Benefits
- **Enhanced User Support:** Provides immediate assistance, reducing the learning curve and helping users resolve issues in real-time.
- **Context-Aware Guidance:** Leverages the repository documentation and runtime state to offer precise answers tailored to user queries.
- **Streamlined Feature Set:** By merging the SCHEDULED_PLOTTING and FILE_WATCHER functionalities into AUTOMATION, the repository maintains an optimal six-feature structure while introducing innovative AI-driven support.

## Summary
The CHAT_ASSISTANT feature enriches our plotting library by offering interactive, AI-driven assistance that simplifies troubleshooting and enhances user engagement. By effectively integrating with our existing CLI and HTTP API systems, this feature aligns with our mission to be the go-to plot library for formula visualisations and elevates the overall user experience.
