# Overview
This feature consolidates command line interface functionalities and now adds configuration support from environment variables. In addition to using CLI flags for plot generation, the tool will check for default values provided via environment variables, offering a fallback mechanism using dotenv. This ensures a smoother experience for users who prefer pre-configured settings.

# Validation and Input Handling
The enhanced CLI_ENHANCEMENTS feature performs strict validation of input values, whether provided as CLI flags or loaded from environment variables. The following validations are enforced:
1. When CLI flags (--expression, --range, --file) are provided, all must be present with non-empty values. If any are missing, an error is thrown.
2. If no CLI flags for plot generation are provided, the system checks if the environment variables PLOT_EXPRESSION, PLOT_RANGE, and PLOT_FILE are set. If they are present and non-empty, these values are used to generate the plot.
3. The expression value must start with the character y= and include valid mathematical symbols.
4. The range value is validated using a regular expression that enforces the format: x=<min>:<max>,y=<min>:<max> with support for integers and floating point numbers.
5. The file flag or environment variable must specify a path ending in .svg or .png. Unsupported file extensions will result in a clear error message.

# Plot Generation and Output
After successful validation, the feature proceeds to generate plots as before:
1. For SVG output, an SVG image is generated containing a text annotation that includes the provided expression and range.
2. For PNG output, a PNG image buffer is generated from a dummy base64 encoded image data.
3. A success message is logged and output to indicate the generated plot along with details of the expression, range, and file location.

# CLI and Configuration Fallback
1. At the very start, dotenv is used to load environment variables from a .env file if present.
2. If the command is executed without the plot generation flags, the system checks if the environment variables (PLOT_EXPRESSION, PLOT_RANGE, PLOT_FILE) are set.
3. When these environment variables are found and valid, the plot generation process is automatically triggered using these default settings.
4. If neither CLI flags nor a complete set of environment variables is provided, the tool shows a run message or falls back to server mode if the --serve flag is used.

# Testing and Documentation
1. Unit tests in the CLI test suite will be updated to include scenarios where environment variables are used instead of CLI flags.
2. Tests will ensure that configuration values loaded from the environment are validated in the same way as CLI inputs.
3. The README and usage guides are updated to document the use of environment variables for default configuration.
4. Documentation in CONTRIBUTING.md and MISSION.md remains consistent with these enhancements, underlining improved usability and flexibility.

# Impact and Alignment
By adding configuration support via environment variables, the enhanced CLI_ENHANCEMENTS feature reduces the need for repetitive command-line input. This improvement aligns with the mission to be the go-to plot library, offering users both interactive CLI mode and pre-configured defaults. Developers benefit from simplified testing and deployment scenarios, while end users can streamline their workflow by setting default plot parameters once and reusing them.
