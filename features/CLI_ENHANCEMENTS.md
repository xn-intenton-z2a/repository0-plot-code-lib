# Overview
This feature consolidates and upgrades the command line interface by merging several CLI-related improvements into one streamlined system. It incorporates the help message functionality (previously defined in CLI_HELP) along with diagnostics, verbose logging, and robust argument validation. The unified CLI experience makes the tool more user-friendly and transparent, aligning with the mission of being the go-to CLI for generating plots and time series data.

# Implementation
## Source Code Changes (src/lib/main.js)
- **Help Mode Integration:**
  - Add an early check for the `--help` flag. When detected, output a comprehensive usage guide that details all options (`--expression`, `--range`, `--file`, `--samples`, `--maintenance`, `--diagnostics`, `--verbose`, and `--help`).
  - Ensure that after displaying the help message, no further processing occurs.
- **Unified CLI Improvements:**
  - Retain the maintenance check and file generation logic.
  - Integrate Zod-based input validation for required options. In case of validation errors, output a clear error message along with usage instructions.
  - Maintain advanced diagnostic outputs when `--diagnostics` is provided, including tool version, Node.js version, and input arguments.
  - Enable verbose logging using the `--verbose` flag to log key processing steps (parsing, validation, evaluation, and file writing).

## Test Updates
- Update existing tests to cover the help mode functionality, ensuring that when `--help` is passed, the output contains detailed instructions for all CLI options.
- Merge tests from the previous CLI_HELP feature into the CLI_ENHANCEMENTS test suite.
- Ensure that tests for diagnostics, logging, and input validation are comprehensive and maintain existing test coverage.

## Documentation Updates (README.md)
- Revise the CLI Usage section to include information about the `--help` flag and its output, consolidating the documentation previously found in CLI_HELP into the CLI_ENHANCEMENTS section.
- Remove any redundant help sections and clearly document the complete set of CLI options and usage scenarios.

# Compatibility and Mission Alignment
- The enhancements are fully backward compatible with the current functionality.
- The updated CLI interface improves usability and transparency, reinforcing the mission of providing a reliable and accessible tool for generating visual plots and time series data.
- By merging help functionality with diagnostics and logging, the tool becomes a single cohesive utility, simplifying maintenance and future enhancements.
