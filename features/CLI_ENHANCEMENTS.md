# Overview
This feature consolidates command line interface functionalities into one robust entry point. It merges existing validation and plot generation logic into a single module to ensure improved maintainability and enhanced user experience.

# Validation and Input Handling
The consolidated CLI_ENHANCEMENTS feature enforces strict validation of input flags. It ensures that when the CLI mode is activated with flags for expression, range, and file, the following checks are performed:
1. Validate that all required flags --expression, --range, and --file are provided concurrently with non-empty values.
2. Ensure the --expression value begins with y= and contains valid mathematical characters.
3. Verify the --range flag matches the pattern x=<min>:<max>,y=<min>:<max> with proper numeric boundaries.
4. Confirm the --file flag specifies a file with a .svg or .png extension, and provide clear error messages for unsupported values or formats.

# Plot Generation and Output
Following successful validation, the CLI_ENHANCEMENTS feature proceeds to generate plots:
1. For .svg output, it creates an SVG image with a text annotation reflecting the provided expression and range.
2. For .png output, it generates a PNG buffer using dummy base64 encoded image data.
3. The system is designed to print a success message indicating details of the generated plot and file location.

# Testing and Documentation
Comprehensive unit tests will be included in the test suite to simulate various CLI scenarios, including invalid inputs, missing flags, and supported file extensions. Documentation in README and usage guides will be updated to reflect the consolidated CLI invocation examples and error handling details.

# Impact and Alignment
By merging validation and plot generation into a unified CLI feature, the repository reduces code duplication and enhances the overall usability of the tool. This aligns with our mission to create a go-to, reliable plot library for formula visualization.
