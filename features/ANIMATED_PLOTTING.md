# ANIMATED_PLOTTING Feature Specification

## Description
This feature introduces animated plotting capabilities to the library, allowing users to generate dynamic visualizations that evolve over time. Using this mode, the plotting tool can create sequences of frames—compiled into animated GIFs or video files—that demonstrate how mathematical functions change, offering a clear, time-based perspective on their behavior.

## Motivation
- **Dynamic Visualization:** Go beyond static plots to showcase temporal evolutions, making it easier to understand functions that vary with time or exhibit oscillatory behavior.
- **Enhanced Engagement:** Animated plots provide a more intuitive and engaging representation of mathematical phenomena, increasing the tool's appeal for education, demonstrations, and exploratory data analysis.
- **Mission Alignment:** Further the mission of being the go-to plotting library by incorporating modern, interactive visual outputs that resonate with both novice users and professionals.

## Implementation Details
1. **CLI Integration:**
   - Introduce a new CLI flag (e.g., `--animate`) that triggers animated plotting mode.
   - Allow additional parameters like `--frames` (number of frames), `--duration` (total animation length), and optionally `--delay` (time between frames) to control the animation.
   - Adjust the main entry point in `src/lib/main.js` to interpret these flags and branch into the animation workflow.

2. **Animation Workflow:**
   - **Frame Generation:** Leverage the existing plotting logic to generate a sequence of individual frames based on gradually changing parameters or time steps. Reuse numeric parsing and validation to ensure each frame's input is valid.
   - **Assembly:** Combine the generated frames into an animated format (e.g., GIF). Consider using an optional dependency or integrating with a lightweight encoder if available. Clearly document any additional dependency required.
   - **Output:** Support output file formats commonly used for animations such as `.gif` or video formats. Provide proper error messaging if the output format is unsupported.

3. **Error Handling and Testing:**
   - Validate that the required parameters (and frame count) are provided, and that numeric inputs for time progression are valid.
   - Extend the unit tests to simulate animated plot generation and verify that sequences are correctly assembled into the final output.
   - Ensure the animation mode fails gracefully when parameters are missing or invalid, providing informative error messages to the user.

4. **Documentation and Examples:**
   - Update the README and CONTRIBUTING guidelines to describe animated plotting mode, including examples and parameter explanations.
   - Provide sample usage:
     ```bash
     node src/lib/main.js --animate output.gif "sine:1,1,0,0,360,30" --frames 30 --duration 1000
     ```

## Usage
- **Animated Plot Generation:**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --animate output.gif "sine:1,1,0,0,360,30" --frames 30 --duration 1000
  ```
- **Parameter Details:**
   - `--animate`: Activates animated plotting mode.
   - `--frames <number>`: Sets the total number of frames to generate.
   - `--duration <milliseconds>`: Determines the total duration of the animation.

This feature empowers users to visualize temporal aspects of mathematical functions in a dynamic, engaging way, fulfilling the promise of our mission to be the ultimate tool for innovative formula visualizations.
