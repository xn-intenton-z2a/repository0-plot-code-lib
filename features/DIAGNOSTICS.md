# DIAGNOSTICS Feature Specification

## Overview
The DIAGNOSTICS feature introduces a comprehensive system check and troubleshooting utility accessible via the CLI. This feature empowers developers and users to quickly validate the health of critical components such as the PLOT_ENGINE and HTTP_API integrations. In this update, we extend its capabilities to include performance metrics, providing insights into execution times and resource usage. This enhancement aligns with our mission to be the go-to plot library by not only confirming the operational state of the system but also highlighting performance aspects, helping users and developers optimize plotting operations.

## Implementation Details
### CLI Flag Integration
- Introduce a `--diagnostics` command-line flag in the main entry point (e.g., `src/lib/main.js`).
- When provided, trigger the diagnostics routine instead of the standard execution path.

### Health Checks
- Retrieve and display the Node version and versions of key dependencies (e.g., Express, mathjs).
- Run basic checks on critical components:
  - Evaluate the PLOT_ENGINE by computing a test expression and comparing the output with expected patterns.
  - Validate HTTP_API endpoints by performing self-tests on essential routes (such as `/plot` and `/docs`).

### Performance Metrics
- **Execution Timing:** Use Node's high-resolution timers (`process.hrtime`) to measure the execution time of major routines, including plot generation and API request handling.
- **Resource Usage:** Capture basic CPU and memory usage metrics during diagnostics to help identify performance bottlenecks.
- **Reporting:** Format the performance data alongside the system health report, presenting metrics in a user-friendly format with suggestions for further tuning if needed.

### Output and Reporting
- Present diagnostic results in a clearly formatted report that includes:
  - Environment configuration details
  - Dependency versions
  - Health check results for PLOT_ENGINE and HTTP_API
  - Performance metrics (execution times and resource usage statistics)
- Include actionable hints for addressing common issues like misconfigured environment variables, dependency version mismatches, or performance slowdowns.

### Integration Considerations
- Ensure that running diagnostics (with or without performance metrics) does not impact normal CLI or HTTP API operations.
- Maintain backward compatibility so that users not invoking the diagnostics flag experience no changes in behavior.

## Testing and Documentation
### Unit Tests
- Create tests simulating the `--diagnostics` flag to capture and validate the output, including performance metric data.
- Verify that all system information and performance metrics are correctly formatted and accurately reported.

### Documentation
- Update the README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md files with a detailed section on the diagnostics feature. 
- Provide usage examples illustrating how to invoke diagnostics and interpret the performance metrics.

## Usage Example
- **CLI Command:**
  - Run: `node src/lib/main.js --diagnostics`
  - Expected output: A formatted diagnostic report displaying Node and dependency versions, PLOT_ENGINE test evaluation, HTTP_API endpoint status, and performance metrics.
