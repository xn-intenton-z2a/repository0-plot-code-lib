# DIAGNOSTICS Feature Specification

## Overview
The DIAGNOSTICS feature introduces a comprehensive system check and troubleshooting utility accessible via the CLI. This feature empowers developers and users to quickly validate the health of critical components such as the PLOT_ENGINE and HTTP_API integrations. In this update, we extend its capabilities to include performance metrics and automated recommendations. This enhancement aligns with our mission to be the go-to plot library by not only confirming the operational state of the system but also offering actionable suggestions to optimize plotting operations.

## Implementation Details
### CLI Flag Integration
- Introduce a `--diagnostics` command-line flag in the main entry point (e.g., `src/lib/main.js`).
- When provided, trigger the diagnostics routine instead of the standard execution path.

### Health Checks and Performance Metrics
- **Environment Information:** Retrieve and display the Node version and versions of key dependencies (e.g., Express, mathjs).
- **Component Validation:**
  - Evaluate the PLOT_ENGINE by computing a test expression and comparing the output with expected patterns.
  - Validate HTTP_API endpoints by performing self-tests on essential routes (such as `/plot` and `/docs`).
- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Use Node's high-resolution timers (`process.hrtime`) to measure execution times of major routines (plot generation, API handling).
  - Capture resource usage (CPU, memory) during diagnostics to identify performance bottlenecks.
  - Present the performance data alongside system health in a formatted report.

### Automated Recommendations
- **Issue Detection:** Analyze diagnostic data to detect common misconfigurations such as environment variable errors, dependency mismatches, or performance slowdowns.
- **Actionable Hints:** Offer specific suggestions (e.g., "Consider increasing available memory" or "Upgrade dependency version X to improve performance") based on the detected metrics.
- **User Guidance:** Provide links to further documentation (via the README or CONTRIBUTING guides) for detailed troubleshooting steps.

### Output and Reporting
- **Report Format:** Combine system health details, performance metrics, and automated recommendations into a neatly formatted, multi-section report.
- **Non-Intrusive Operation:** Ensure running diagnostics (with or without performance metrics) does not alter normal CLI or HTTP API behaviors.

## Testing and Documentation
### Unit Tests
- Simulate the `--diagnostics` flag to capture and validate report output including health metrics and recommendations.
- Verify that diagnostic data is correctly formatted and aligns with expected performance parameters.

### Documentation
- Update the README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md files with detailed instructions and usage examples for invoking diagnostics.
- Include examples outlining how to interpret both the health report and suggested recommendations.

## Usage Example
- **CLI Command:**
  - Run: `node src/lib/main.js --diagnostics`
  - Expected Output: A formatted diagnostic report displaying environment details, component health indicators, performance metrics, and actionable suggestions for addressing identified issues.
