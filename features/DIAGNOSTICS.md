# DIAGNOSTICS Feature Specification

## Description
This feature introduces a diagnostics mode to the CLI application. When triggered with the `--diagnostics` flag, the application will execute a series of self-tests and health checks across core modules—such as parameter validation and advanced plotting—to verify the system configuration and module integrity. The diagnostics feature will output a concise report, indicating the status of each subsystem, configuration details, and any anomalies detected.

## Motivation
- **Reliability:** Provides immediate feedback on the health and configuration of the system, allowing users and developers to verify that the application is functioning as expected.
- **Debugging:** Facilitates rapid troubleshooting by pinpointing issues in specific modules, such as parameter validation errors or advanced plotting failures.
- **User Confidence:** Ensures that updates or changes do not break core functionalities, reinforcing our mission of being the go-to plot library with a robust and maintainable codebase.

## Implementation Details
1. **Flag Detection and Routing:**
   - Update the CLI parser in `src/lib/main.js` to detect the `--diagnostics` flag early in the execution.
   - When this flag is present, bypass normal operations and execute diagnostic routines instead.

2. **Module Health Checks:**
   - **Parameter Validation Test:** Run a set of predefined numeric input tests (both valid and invalid cases) to ensure the `paramValidation` module is operating correctly.
   - **Advanced Plotting Test:** Execute a dry-run of each advanced plotting function from the `advancedPlots` module, logging any exceptions or inconsistencies.
   - **Configuration Verification:** Check for the existence of required environmental configurations (e.g., web server port, dependency versions) and report discrepancies.

3. **Reporting:**
   - Collate the results of each test into a structured report.
   - Output this report to the console, using appropriate error messages and status indicators for any failed checks.
   - Optionally, provide a summary status code if executed in a CI/CD environment.

4. **Testing and Documentation:**
   - Add unit tests in `tests/unit/diagnostics.test.js` to cover each diagnostic routine.
   - Update the README and CONTRIBUTING documentation to include usage examples and guidelines for interpreting the diagnostics output.

## Usage Examples
- **CLI Diagnostics:**
  ```bash
  npm run diagnostics
  # or
  node src/lib/main.js --diagnostics
  ```

This will trigger the diagnostics mode and display a comprehensive health check report for the system.
