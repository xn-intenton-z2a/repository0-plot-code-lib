# DIAGNOSTICS Feature Specification

## Description
This feature introduces a diagnostics mode that allows users to run health checks and environment verifications for the plotting library. By invoking the diagnostics mode (using the `--diagnostics` flag), the application will perform a series of tests including configuration validation, dependency checks, and environment status reporting. The diagnostics information will help users and developers identify configuration issues, incompatible dependency versions, and runtime anomalies.

## Motivation
- **Enhanced Troubleshooting:** Quickly identify issues related to configuration, dependency conflicts, or runtime errors, reducing downtime and support overhead.
- **User Confidence:** Provides transparency into the systemâ€™s operational status, reinforcing the reliability of the plotting tool.
- **Developer Tools:** Assists maintainers and contributors by providing detailed reports that can be used to debug and optimize performance, ensuring adherence to the mission of being the go-to plotting library.

## Implementation Details
1. **CLI Integration:**
   - Detect the `--diagnostics` flag in the main entry point (`src/lib/main.js`).
   - Branch the execution flow to initialize a diagnostics session instead of the default plotting actions.

2. **Diagnostics Checks:**
   - **Configuration Validation:** Verify configuration files (JSON/YAML) and check for any schema mismatches or missing required parameters.
   - **Dependency Check:** Report installed versions of key dependencies (e.g., `express`, `mathjs`, `zod`) and compare them against recommended versions.
   - **Environment Verification:** Check for Node.js version compatibility and environmental variables required for extended features (e.g. `dotenv` configurations).
   - **Error Logging:** Scan recent error logs or output messages (if available) to highlight common issues encountered during runtime.

3. **Output Reporting:**
   - Display a summary report in the console with sections for each diagnostics check.
   - Use color-coded output to highlight errors (e.g., red for critical issues, yellow for warnings) and successful checks in green.
   - Optionally, allow a verbose mode (`--verbose`) to display detailed diagnostics for each check.

4. **Integration with Tests:**
   - Add unit tests to simulate diagnostics mode, verifying that the correct reports are generated and that error cases are properly handled without causing the process to terminate unexpectedly.

## Usage
- **Basic Diagnostics Mode:**
   ```bash
   node src/lib/main.js --diagnostics
   ```
- **Verbose Diagnostics Mode:**
   ```bash
   node src/lib/main.js --diagnostics --verbose
   ```

Upon invocation, the diagnostics feature will perform sequential checks and output a clear, formatted report detailing the health of the current plotting environment.
