# DIAGNOSTICS Feature Specification

## Overview
The DIAGNOSTICS feature introduces a comprehensive system check and troubleshooting utility accessible via the CLI. This feature empowers both developers and users to quickly validate the health of critical components such as the PLOT_ENGINE and HTTP_API integrations, ensuring that all dependencies and configurations are operating correctly. This aligns with our mission to be the go-to plot library by offering immediate insights into the system's operational state.

## Implementation Details
- **CLI Flag Integration:**
  - Introduce a '--diagnostics' command-line flag within the main entry point (src/lib/main.js).
  - When the flag is set, trigger the diagnostics routine instead of the standard execution path.

- **Health Checks:**
  - Retrieve and display the Node version and versions of key dependencies (e.g., Express, mathjs, and others).
  - Run basic checks on the PLOT_ENGINE by evaluating a test expression and comparing the output against expected patterns.
  - For the HTTP_API, perform a self-test to confirm that essential routes (such as `/plot`) are correctly set up and responsive.
  
- **Output and Reporting:**
  - Format the diagnostic output for readability, including summaries of environment configurations and any detected issues.
  - Provide actionable hints for resolving common problems (e.g., missing environment setups, dependency mismatches).
  
- **Integration Considerations:**
  - Ensure that invoking the diagnostics routine does not interfere with the normal operation of the CLI, HTTP API, or library functions.
  - Maintain backward compatibility so that users not using the diagnostics flag experience no change in behavior.

## Testing and Documentation
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Write tests to simulate the '--diagnostics' flag input and capture the output for validation.
  - Verify that all expected system information (Node version, dependency versions, etc.) is correctly displayed and formatted.

- **Documentation:**
  - Update the README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md files to include a section on using the diagnostics feature with examples.
  - Provide troubleshooting guidelines to help users interpret diagnostic output and resolve potential issues.

## Usage Example
- **CLI Command:**
  - Run: `node src/lib/main.js --diagnostics`
  - Expected output: A formatted report including Node version, dependency versions, basic PLOT_ENGINE evaluation result, and HTTP_API test status.
