# PLOT_NOTIFICATIONS Feature Specification

## Description
This feature introduces automated notification capabilities into the plotting tool. It enables the system to inform users when plot generation tasks, batch processes, or scheduled plot exports are completedâ€”either successfully or with warnings/errors. Notifications can be configured to be sent via email, integrated messaging platforms (e.g., Slack), or displayed as pop-up alerts in the web interface. This enhancement allows users to monitor long-running or asynchronous tasks without constantly checking the CLI or web dashboard.

## Motivation
- **Improved Workflow:** Users working with large datasets or scheduled tasks can be alerted upon task completion, ensuring immediate awareness of results or issues without manual intervention.
- **Enhanced Productivity:** By receiving notifications, users can focus on other tasks while the plotting tool handles heavy computation, then quickly review critical outcomes when alerted.
- **Mission Alignment:** This feature supports our goal of being the go-to plot library by streamlining the user experience and making both CLI and web interactions more responsive to user needs in real-time.

## Implementation Details
1. **CLI Integration:**
   - Introduce a new flag (e.g., `--notify`) that accepts a notification method such as an email address or messaging channel identifier.
   - Allow users to combine this flag with other commands (including batch processing and scheduling) so that upon task completion, the tool sends a notification with status and a summary of the task.

2. **Web Interface Integration:**
   - Add a notification panel where alert messages are displayed when plot jobs finish. This panel can be integrated with existing status dashboards.
   - Include options for desktop alerts or in-browser pop-ups using modern Web APIs.

3. **Configuration and Extensibility:**
   - Allow configuration of notification preferences via a configuration file (JSON) or through the web interface. Users can set default notification channels and thresholds for warnings or errors.
   - Integrate with external APIs (e.g., SMTP for email, Slack API for messaging) to provide flexible notification options.

4. **Testing and Documentation:**
   - Develop unit and end-to-end tests to simulate task completion and verify that notifications are correctly generated and dispatched.
   - Update the README and CONTRIBUTING guidelines with examples and instructions for setting up and troubleshooting notifications.

## Usage
- **CLI Example:**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --batch commands.txt --notify user@example.com
  ```
  This command processes a batch of plot commands and sends an email notification once processing is complete.

- **Web Interface Example:**
   - Launch the web server and navigate to the settings panel.
   - Configure your preferred notification method (e.g., email or Slack channel).
   - When a scheduled plot is generated or a batch job completes, a notification will appear in the dashboard and/or be sent via the configured method.
