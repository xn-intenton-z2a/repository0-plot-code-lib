# DRY_RUN Feature Specification

## Overview
This feature introduces a simulation mode into the CLI tool that allows users and developers to preview actions without executing them. When enabled, the tool will parse and validate all provided arguments and display a summary of the operations that would be performed (such as plotting parameters, diagnostics checks, and API calls) without triggering any actual computations, file operations, or network calls. This aligns with our mission by providing an additional safety net and debugging support while preserving the integrity of operations.

## Implementation Details
### CLI Integration
- **Flag Addition:** Introduce a new `--dry-run` (or shorthand `-r`) flag into the main CLI entry point (in `src/lib/main.js`).
- **Simulation Mode:** When the `--dry-run` flag is provided, the system should:
  - Parse and validate all incoming arguments for existing features (e.g., PLOT_ENGINE, DIAGNOSTICS, HTTP_API, etc.).
  - Instead of executing the commands, output a detailed summary of what actions would have been taken, including which routines (plot generation, diagnostics, export, etc.) would be invoked and with what parameters.
  - Ensure that this simulation does not trigger external operations like file writing, network calls, or modifications to history logs.

### Reporting and Output
- **Detailed Report:** The simulation mode will generate a report formatted in plain text (or optionally JSON if combined with logging flags) listing:
  - The resolved command-line flags and their corresponding values.
  - The intended actions for each feature (e.g., generate ASCII plot, record history entry, perform system health checks).
  - Warnings for any parameters that would have caused errors in normal execution (e.g., malformed plot commands).
  
- **Non-invasive Execution:** Guarantee the dry run does not alter any internal state, mimicking a true preview.

## Testing and Documentation
### Unit and Integration Tests
- Develop tests that verify: 
  - With the `--dry-run` flag active, no external operations are executed.
  - The CLI correctly parses and outputs an accurate summary of the actions without side effects.
  - Existing features maintain correct behavior when `--dry-run` is not present.

### Documentation
- Update the README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md files to include usage examples of the `--dry-run` flag, enabling new users and developers to safely test commands.
- Provide guidelines and examples to help interpret the output of a dry run simulation.

## Usage Examples
- **Basic Dry Run Command:**
  - Run: `node src/lib/main.js --plot "sin(x)" --dry-run`
  - Expected output: A simulation report summarizing that a plot of "sin(x)" would be generated with default parameters without actually processing the plot.
- **Combined Usage:**
  - Run: `node src/lib/main.js --diagnostics --dry-run`
  - Expected output: A detailed summary of the diagnostics checks that would have been performed, including version checks, system health, and performance metrics.
