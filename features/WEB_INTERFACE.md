# WEB_INTERFACE Feature Specification

## Description
This feature introduces a web-based interactive plotting interface to complement the existing CLI modes. Rather than relying on command-line input alone, users can access a browser-based front-end allowing them to select plot types, enter mathematical formulas, and view results interactively. The web interface will provide a more intuitive, visual experience tailored to users who prefer graphical interaction over terminal usage.

## Motivation
- **Accessibility:** Provides platform-independent access through any modern web browser.
- **Enhanced User Experience:** Offers intuitive control with form inputs, dynamic previews, and instant visual feedback.
- **Integration:** Complements the CLI features while also opening opportunities for integration with web services and embedding in dashboards.

## Implementation Details
1. **CLI Integration:**
   - Introduce a new CLI flag `--serve` that launches an Express server.
   - Modify the main entry point (`src/lib/main.js`) to check for the `--serve` flag and initialize the web server accordingly.

2. **Express Server Setup:**
   - Configure an Express server to listen on a configurable port (default, e.g., 3000).
   - Serve static assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) from a designated directory (e.g., `public/`).

3. **API Endpoints:**
   - Create RESTful endpoints for plot generation. For instance, a POST endpoint `/plot` that accepts plot parameters and returns the generated plot in the desired format (SVG, PNG, etc.).
   - Implement error handling and logging for all API endpoints.

4. **Front-End Application:**
   - Develop a minimal front-end interface allowing users to choose a plot type, input parameters, and view the output.
   - Use AJAX or Fetch API to interact with the back-end APIs.
   - Provide documentation and inline help so users understand how to define formulas and adjust plot settings.

5. **Testing and Documentation:**
   - **Unit Tests:** Develop tests to check the server initialization, endpoint responses, and error handling (e.g., using Supertest and Vitest).
   - **Documentation:** Update the README and CONTRIBUTING guidelines to include setup instructions and usage examples for the web interface.

## Usage
- **Start the Web Interface:**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --serve
  ```
- **Access via Browser:**
  Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the configured port) to access the interactive plotting interface.
- **API Usage:**
  Use the provided API endpoints to integrate with other services or to generate plots programmatically.
