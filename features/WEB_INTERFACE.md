# WEB_INTERFACE Feature (Enhanced)

## Overview
This feature combines the HTTP API for plotting with enhanced debugging and diagnostic capabilities. It unifies the endpoints required for plot submission, health checks, and detailed diagnostics, streamlining the user experience and reducing code duplication. The consolidated web interface remains aligned with our mission of being the go-to tool for formula visualisations while supporting both interactive plotting and comprehensive error tracking.

## API Endpoints
- **POST /plot**: Accepts a JSON payload containing plotting commands and configuration. It supports both numeric parameter sequences and detailed JSON-based configurations. The endpoint validates input using robust Zod validation routines inherited from the CORE_ENGINE.
- **GET /health**: Provides a simple health check confirming the service is running normally.
- **GET /debug**: Returns detailed diagnostic information including current configuration settings, environment variables, processing metrics, and error logs. This endpoint supports developers in troubleshooting and performance monitoring.

## Implementation Considerations
- **Single Source File Integration**: The enhanced web interface should be implemented in a single source file (e.g., `src/web/app.js`) while reusing the CORE_ENGINE routines for numeric parsing and JSON configuration.
- **Error Handling & Logging**: Leverage existing error handling callbacks and Zod schema validation to ensure consistent error messaging. Detailed logging should be enabled for debugging when requested through the /debug endpoint.
- **Testing**: Extend the current test suites to cover the unified web endpoints, ensuring that the /plot, /health, and /debug endpoints work correctly, including edge cases and invalid inputs.
- **Documentation**: Update README and CONTRIBUTING documentation to reflect the new, merged web interface features, with examples for CLI and HTTP usage.

## Benefits
- **Unified Access**: Merges plotting and debugging capabilities under a single HTTP service, reducing maintenance overhead and simplifying deployment.
- **Enhanced Debugging**: Provides real-time diagnostic information via the /debug endpoint, improving troubleshooting in both development and production environments.
- **Mission Alignment**: Supports our goal of being the go-to plot library through improved reliability, better error messaging, and a seamless API for both plotting and diagnostics.
