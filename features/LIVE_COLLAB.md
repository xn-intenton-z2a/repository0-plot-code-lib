# LIVE_COLLAB Feature Specification

## Description
This feature introduces real-time collaborative editing for the web interface of the plotting tool. With LIVE_COLLAB, multiple users can simultaneously work on, edit, and annotate plots in a shared environment. Changes made by one user are reflected in real-time for all participants, allowing for improved teamwork during data exploration and visualization creation.

## Motivation
- **Enhanced Teamwork:** Facilitates joint analysis and decision-making by enabling multiple users to contribute to the same plot in real-time.
- **Interactive Presentations:** Improves collaborative presentations and remote meetings by allowing live modifications that are instantly visible to all participants.
- **Mission Alignment:** Strengthens our commitment to being the go-to plotting library by extending our functionality to support modern, collaborative workflows.

## Implementation Details
1. **Web Interface Integration:**
   - Extend the current web interface to include a collaborative editing panel. This panel will support user authentication and session management to enable multiple users to join the same editing session.
   - Implement a dedicated URL endpoint (e.g., `/collab`) for initiating or joining collaborative sessions.

2. **Real-time Synchronization:**
   - Use WebSocket or similar real-time communication protocols to propagate changes made by any user to all connected clients instantaneously.
   - Ensure that the underlying plot data and configuration are synchronized across sessions, with conflict resolution mechanisms in place to handle simultaneous edits.

3. **Session Management and Security:**
   - Integrate user session handling to maintain individual user contexts within a collaborative session.
   - Secure the collaborative endpoints using authentication (e.g., via tokens) and enforce permissions to ensure that only authorized users can join a session.

4. **Logging and Persistence:**
   - Record changes and user interactions during a session for replay, auditing, or macro recording purposes. This history can later be exported or used for session rollback.

5. **Testing and Documentation:**
   - Develop unit and integration tests to simulate multi-user interactions and validate proper synchronization of plot modifications.
   - Update both the README and CONTRIBUTING documentation to include usage examples, guidelines for session management, and troubleshooting tips.

## Usage
- **Web Interface Example:**
  - Launch the web server using `npm run start:web`.
  - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/collab` to start or join a collaborative plotting session.
  - Users can invite collaborators via a session link, and all modifications (plot adjustments, annotations, theme changes) will be shared in real-time.

- **CLI Considerations:**
  - While primarily a web-based feature, integration with CLI-generated plots is planned for future enhancements where session data can be exported for reproducibility.

This LIVE_COLLAB feature will elevate the plotting tool by incorporating modern, real-time collaboration, making it not only a versatile visualization engine but also a robust, shared workspace for data-driven insights.
