# ERROR_LOGGER Feature Specification

## Overview
This feature introduces a centralized error logging mechanism designed to capture and consolidate error events from across the entire plotting library. ERROR_LOGGER will serve both the CLI and HTTP (or web server) components, logging errors from scheduled tasks, plot generation, configuration validation, and API endpoints. It aims to provide developers and users with a clear audit trail of issues, along with integrated tools for viewing and analyzing logs. This enhancement aligns with our mission by ensuring that errors are not only handled gracefully but are also tracked for proactive maintenance and improved reliability.

## Implementation Details
- **Single Source File:** ERROR_LOGGER will be implemented as a dedicated module (e.g., `src/lib/errorLogger.js`) that can be imported and used across other modules.
- **Logging Mechanism:**
  - Captures errors thrown by CLI commands, HTTP endpoints, and scheduled tasks.
  - Supports logging to a local file (e.g., `logs/error.log`) with basic log rotation capabilities.
  - Optionally integrates with external logging services if configured via environment variables (e.g., `EXTERNAL_LOG_ENDPOINT`).
- **Integration Hooks:**
  - Exposes functions to log errors, warnings, and informational messages.
  - Can be hooked into the unified error handling flows in both the CLI and merged WEB_SERVER module.
  - Provides a CLI flag (e.g., `--view-logs`) to display recent log entries directly from the terminal.
- **Configuration:**
  - Allows configurable log levels (error, warn, info, debug) via environment variables or JSON configuration files.
  - Ensures minimal performance overhead by asynchronous logging and optional batching of log writes.

## Testing and Documentation
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Create tests simulating various error scenarios to ensure that errors are correctly captured and logged in the appropriate format.
  - Validate that log rotation and external logging features work as expected.
- **Integration Tests:**
  - Verify that errors generated from CLI commands, scheduled tasks, and HTTP endpoints are correctly routed through ERROR_LOGGER.
- **Documentation Updates:**
  - Update README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md to include usage examples, configuration instructions, and troubleshooting guidelines for accessing error logs.

## Benefits
- **Enhanced Reliability:** Centralized error logging provides a single point of reference for diagnosing issues across the application.
- **Proactive Maintenance:** With accurate logging, developers can quickly identify recurring problems and address them proactively.
- **User Empowerment:** The integrated CLI log viewing capability helps users understand failures and aids in quick resolutions.

## Summary
The ERROR_LOGGER feature adds a robust and centralized error tracking system to the repository. By capturing errors from the CLI, HTTP endpoints, scheduled plotting, and the core plotting engine, it not only improves the overall reliability of the tool but also aligns with our mission to be the go-to plot library by simplifying maintenance and user troubleshooting.
