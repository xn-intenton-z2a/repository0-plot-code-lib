# FORECASTING Feature Specification

## Description
This feature introduces automated forecasting capabilities to the plotting library. By analyzing historical datasets—especially time-series data—the tool can generate future predictions and display them alongside existing plots. The forecasted output includes confidence intervals and trend extrapolations, providing users with actionable insights regarding upcoming data trends.

## Motivation
- **Data-Driven Decisions:** Forecasting helps users anticipate future events based on past trends, which is essential for financial analysis, inventory planning, and performance monitoring.
- **Enhanced Visual Insights:** Integrating forecast models directly into the plotting tool allows users to visualize both historical data and future predictions in a single, cohesive view.
- **Mission Alignment:** This feature reinforces our mission to be the go-to plot library by extending its analytical capacity to predictive modeling and advanced formula-based visualizations.

## Implementation Details
1. **CLI Integration:**
   - Introduce a new flag (e.g., `--forecast`) that activates the forecasting mode.
   - Allow users to specify parameters such as forecast horizon (number of future periods) and confidence level.
   - Validate that the input data is time-series based and contains sufficient historical points for reliable prediction.

2. **Data Processing and Modeling:**
   - Integrate a simple forecasting algorithm using available libraries (or a custom ARIMA-like method leveraging mathjs) to compute future values based on historical trends.
   - Compute forecasted values along with upper and lower confidence bounds.
   - Ensure robustness through error handling for cases such as insufficient data or non-time-series input.

3. **Rendering Engine Enhancements:**
   - Modify the existing plot rendering pipeline to overlay forecasted trends and confidence intervals on the current plot.
   - Provide options to customize the appearance (e.g., dashed lines for predictions, shaded areas for confidence intervals) via CLI flags or web interface controls.

4. **Web Interface Integration:**
   - Add controls for setting forecast parameters (e.g., horizon slider, confidence level input) in the web interface.
   - Enable real-time preview of forecasted outputs as users adjust parameters interactively.

5. **Testing and Documentation:**
   - Develop unit and integration tests to simulate forecasting on historical datasets and verify correct overlay of predictions.
   - Update the README and CONTRIBUTING documentation with usage examples, parameter details, and troubleshooting guidelines for forecasting scenarios.

## Usage
- **CLI Example:**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --import time_series.csv --plot "line:date,value" --forecast --horizon 12 --confidence 95
  ```

- **Web Interface Example:**
   - Launch the web server with `npm run start:web`.
   - Navigate to the forecast section, upload a time-series dataset, and use the interactive controls to set forecast parameters and view the predicted trends along with confidence intervals.
