# CLI_INTERFACE Feature Specification (Enhanced with Guided Wizard, Command Preview, Auto-Completion, Demo Mode, Formula Assistance, Offline Assistance, and Configuration Validation)

## Overview
This feature refines the existing CLI interface by combining interactive plotting command configuration with real-time formula assistance and robust configuration validation. In addition to a guided wizard, detailed command preview, and dynamic auto-completion, the enhanced CLI now integrates expression tracing, auto-correction, a chat module powered by the OpenAI API, and a new offline formula assistance fallback. This consolidation improves onboarding, reduces input errors, and provides on-demand formula helpâ€”all in a single user-friendly command line tool that reinforces our mission to be the go-to plot library for formula visualisations.

## Interactive Guidance and Command Preview
- **Step-by-Step Prompts:** Offers detailed guidance for entering formulas, intervals, steps, and output options with inline help and documentation references.
- **Command Preview:** Displays a final command preview, allowing users to review, edit, or cancel before execution to reduce configuration mistakes.

## Auto-Completion and Assistance
- **Dynamic Suggestions:** Implements auto-completion for command options and flags using the Node.js readline interface, enriched by past command history and context awareness.
- **Formula Assistance Integration:** Supports a `--trace` flag for detailed evaluation logs, an `--autocorrect` flag to suggest corrections for common formula errors, and a `--chat` flag to launch an interactive help session via the OpenAI API.

## Offline Formula Assistance
- **Heuristic Analysis:** When network access is unavailable or the OpenAI API is unresponsive, the CLI automatically falls back to a local heuristic-based engine that uses pattern matching and regular expressions to detect common mistakes in mathematical expressions.
- **Suggestion Engine:** Provides actionable suggestions and corrections for typical errors, ensuring that users can still receive guidance without relying on external services.
- **Seamless Integration:** This offline assistance is integrated transparently into the existing formula help workflow and is activated automatically when API calls fail.

## Demo Mode
- **Interactive Walkthrough:** A new CLI flag (`--demo`) triggers a guided demonstration showing key plotting commands, configuration steps, and output explanations.
- **First-Time User Engagement:** Designed to lower the learning curve and showcase the tool's core capabilities interactively.

## Configuration Validation
- **Validation of Input Sources:** Adds a new module within the CLI that validates configuration sources (environment variables, JSON configuration files, and CLI arguments) before proceeding with execution.
- **Error Reporting:** Provides clear, actionable error messages when inconsistencies or missing parameters are detected.
- **Secure Defaults:** Utilizes secure defaults and fallback values, ensuring that even first-time users have a reliable configuration experience.
- **Integration with Existing Workflow:** Seamlessly works with existing command parsing, ensuring minimal disruption while increasing overall reliability.

## Implementation Details
- **CLI Parser Enhancements:** Extend the existing argument parser to accommodate new flags (`--trace`, `--autocorrect`, `--chat`, `--demo`) and validate configuration inputs.
- **Real-Time Input Handling:** Use Node.js libraries (e.g., readline) to capture user input, provide auto-completion, and trigger context-aware help and validation during interactive sessions.
- **Integrated Chat Module:** A lightweight module interfacing with the OpenAI API, with API key management via environment variables.
- **Offline Assistance Engine:** Implement a fallback engine that utilizes common formula patterns and error heuristics to assist users when the external API is not available.
- **Testing and Documentation Updates:** Update README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md to document configuration validation usage, demo mode, and the offline assistance feature. Comprehensive unit and integration tests will simulate interactive sessions and validate both online and offline formula assistance.

## Benefits
- **Enhanced Usability:** Combines interactive plotting, real-time formula help, offline fallback assistance, and robust configuration validation into a seamless experience.
- **Error Reduction:** Guided prompts, command previews, and immediate validation reduce misconfigurations and user errors.
- **Increased Reliability:** Ensures that all required configurations are validated before execution, thereby reducing runtime errors and ensuring continuous assistance even in offline scenarios.
- **Immediate Support:** On-demand chat assistance complemented by an offline heuristic engine empowers users to correct mistakes efficiently regardless of connectivity.

## Summary
The enhanced CLI_INTERFACE now integrates guided command entry, dynamic auto-completion, interactive demos, real-time and offline formula assistance, and a critical configuration validation module. This holistic approach ensures a reliable, user-friendly interface that aligns with our mission to be the go-to plot library for formula visualisations.
