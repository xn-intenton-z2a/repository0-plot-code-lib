# CLI_INTERFACE Feature Specification (Enhanced with Guided Wizard, Command Preview, Auto-Completion, and Demo Mode)

## Overview
This feature refines the existing CLI interface by integrating an enhanced interactive wizard, detailed command preview, a new auto-completion mechanism, and an interactive demo mode. The demo mode provides first-time users with an engaging walkthrough of the toolâ€™s core plotting functionalities. The feature aims to simplify plotting command configuration, reduce input errors, and onboard new users quickly, all while aligning with our mission to be the go-to plot library for formula visualisations.

## Enhanced Interactive Wizard and Command Preview
- **Interactive Guidance:** Provides step-by-step prompts for parameters such as formulas, intervals, and output options. Inline help and documentation references are available throughout.
- **Command Preview:** Displays a full preview of the final command, allowing users to confirm, edit, or cancel before execution to minimize errors.

## Auto-Completion Enhancement
- **Dynamic Suggestions:** Implements auto-completion for command options and flags using Node.js readline interface. As users type, the system suggests valid commands, flags, and parameter values based on a predefined set and past command history.
- **Context Awareness:** Integrates with the history manager to provide relevant suggestions tailored to frequent user inputs and common plotting scenarios.
- **Seamless Integration:** Works in both guided interactive sessions and non-interactive scenarios to ensure a smooth and user-friendly experience.

## Demo Mode
- **Purpose:** Offers a guided demonstration session that walks new users through key plotting commands and features.
- **Activation:** A new CLI flag `--demo` triggers the demo mode, automatically executing a series of illustrative commands and showing their outputs.
- **Walkthrough:** The demo mode includes:
  - A brief introduction to the plotting capabilities.
  - Step-by-step command execution with explanations for each plotting parameter and sub-feature.
  - An interactive Q&A prompt where users can ask for further clarification during the demo.
- **Benefits:** Reduces the learning curve, improves initial user engagement, and provides a quick reference for regular usage.

## Implementation Details
- **CLI Parsing:** Extend the existing argument parser to handle the new `--demo` flag alongside enhancements for auto-completion and command preview.
- **User Input Handling:** Leverage Node.js libraries (e.g., readline) to capture real-time input and provide suggestions as well as guide the demo walkthrough without disrupting the existing CLI flow.
- **Configuration and Customization:** Allow users to adjust auto-completion sensitivity, demo verbosity, and source of suggestions via command-line flags and configuration files.
- **Documentation:** Update CLI help texts, README.md, and CONTRIBUTING guidelines to include instructions and examples for using the enhanced CLI features, particularly the new demo mode.

## Testing and Quality Assurance
- **Unit and Integration Tests:** Develop tests simulating user input scenarios to verify that auto-complete suggestions, interactive wizard prompts, command previews, and demo mode guidance are accurate and context-aware.
- **User Feedback Loop:** Monitor usage and iteration on the demo mode to ensure it effectively lowers the barrier for new users while reinforcing tool capabilities.

## Benefits
- **Enhanced Usability:** Combined with interactive wizard, command preview, and auto-completion, the new demo mode provides an immediate, hands-on introduction for new users.
- **Error Reduction:** Real-time suggestions and a guided demo reduce the likelihood of typos and misconfigurations, improving overall reliability.
- **Streamlined Onboarding:** The demo mode offers an engaging first-run experience that quickly conveys the power and simplicity of the plotting library, solidifying its position as the go-to tool for formula visualisations.

## Summary
By augmenting the CLI interface with a demo mode in addition to the existing features, we deliver a more guided, error-resistant, and engaging user experience. These improvements make the CLI more accessible to newcomers and more efficient for experienced users, in full support of our mission.
