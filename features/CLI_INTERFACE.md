# CLI_INTERFACE Feature Specification (Enhanced with Guided Wizard, Command Preview, and Auto-Completion)

## Overview
This update refines the existing CLI interface by integrating an enhanced interactive wizard, detailed command preview, and a new auto-completion mechanism. The feature aims to further simplify plotting command configuration and reduce input errors by dynamically suggesting command options and arguments based on context and user history.

## Enhanced Interactive Wizard and Command Preview
- **Interactive Guidance:** Continues to provide step-by-step prompts for parameters such as formulas, intervals, and output options, with inline help and documentation references.
- **Command Preview:** Displays a full preview of the final command, allowing users to confirm, edit, or cancel before execution, minimizing chances of error.

## Auto-Completion Enhancement
- **Dynamic Suggestions:** Implements auto-completion for command options and flags using the Node.js readline interface. As users type, the system suggests valid commands, flags, and parameter values based on a predefined set and past command history.
- **Context Awareness:** Integrates with the history manager to provide relevant suggestions tailored to frequent user inputs and common plotting scenarios.
- **Seamless Integration:** Works in conjunction with the interactive wizard mode to offer both guided input and on-the-fly completions in non-interactive sessions, ensuring a smooth user experience.

## Implementation Details
- **CLI Parsing:** Extend the existing argument parser to include an auto-completion module that intercepts partial input and retrieves suggestions.
- **User Input Handling:** Leverage Node.js libraries (such as readline) to capture real-time input and provide suggestions without disrupting the existing CLI flow.
- **Configuration and Customization:** Allow users to configure auto-completion sensitivity and source (default commands vs. history-based) via command-line flags and configuration files.
- **Documentation:** Update CLI help texts and the README/CONTRIBUTING guidelines to include instructions and examples for using the auto-completion feature.

## Testing and Quality Assurance
- **Unit and Integration Tests:** Develop tests simulating user input scenarios to verify that auto-complete suggestions are accurate and context-aware, and that they integrate smoothly with the interactive wizard.
- **User Feedback Loop:** Monitor usage to ensure the suggestions improve over time based on user interactions, with iterative refinements confirmed by regression tests.

## Benefits
- **Enhanced Usability:** The auto-completion feature further lowers the barrier to entry for new users and speeds up command construction for experienced users.
- **Error Reduction:** Real-time suggestions decrease the likelihood of typos or unsupported flag usage, improving the overall reliability of command execution.
- **Streamlined Workflow:** Combined with the interactive wizard and command preview, the new enhancements provide a cohesive and intuitive CLI experience aligned with our mission of being the go-to plot library for formula visualisations.

## Summary
By augmenting the CLI interface with auto-completion, we offer users a more guided and error-resistant command assembly process. These improvements integrate seamlessly with the existing interactive wizard mode and command preview features, reinforcing a user-friendly and robust experience for both casual and power users.
