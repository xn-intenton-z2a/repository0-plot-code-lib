# CLI_INTERFACE Feature Specification (Enhanced with Guided Wizard and Command Preview)

## Overview
This update refines the existing CLI_INTERFACE feature with an enhanced interactive wizard mode and detailed command preview functionality. It continues to consolidate argument parsing, integrated documentation, version information display, dry-run simulation, and API access. The enhancements focus on improving usability for both beginners and seasoned users by providing a more guided, step-by-step plotting command configuration and validation process.

## Enhanced Interactive Wizard Mode
- **Improved User Guidance:** Utilizes a series of interactive prompts (e.g., using a lightweight Node.js prompting library) to guide users through specifying plot parameters such as the formula, interval, step size, output options, and tagging. This helps users construct valid commands and reduces learning curves.
- **Command Preview & Confirmation:** After collecting inputs, the wizard displays a full preview of the final command, highlighting how individual options translate into the CLI invocation. Users can confirm, edit, or cancel the command, ensuring clarity and control before execution.
- **Contextual Help Integration:** Each prompt includes inline help and links to documentation (as described in README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md) so that users can better understand the available options and the impact on the plotting process.

## Comprehensive CLI Features
- **Unified Argument Parsing:** Supports full-length flags and their shorthand aliases for plot generation, dry-run simulation, diagnostics, and log output. The CLI now also interprets corrections and suggestions from the interactive wizard.
- **Integrated Documentation and Dynamic Help:** Detailed, dynamic help output is available through the `--help` flag, consolidating guidance for all commands and interactive inputs.
- **Version and Library API Exposure:** Users can view version details via the `--version` flag and import the main CLI functionality as a library function in other Node.js projects.

## Testing and Quality Assurance
- **Interactive Workflow Tests:** New unit and integration tests simulate user input for the interactive wizard, verifying the accurate gathering of plot parameters and the correct display of the preview command.
- **Documentation Updates:** All changes are documented in the README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md files, including examples of the enhanced wizard mode with command preview.

## Benefits
- **Lowered Barrier for New Users:** The guided wizard ensures even those unfamiliar with command-line interfaces can construct valid plotting commands easily.
- **Increased Confidence:** The command preview and confirmation step minimizes errors by allowing users to verify the final command configuration before execution.
- **Enhanced Usability:** Merges the benefits of interactive guidance with traditional CLI operations, maintaining consistency across both non-interactive and interactive sessions.

## Summary
The enhanced CLI_INTERFACE feature significantly improves user experience by integrating a detailed interactive wizard mode and command preview functionality. This refinement not only makes the plotting tool more accessible to beginners but also streamlines command execution for advanced users, ensuring the repository remains aligned with our mission to be the go-to plot library for formula visualisations.
