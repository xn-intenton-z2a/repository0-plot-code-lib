# CLI_INTERFACE Feature Specification (Enhanced with Guided Wizard, Command Preview, Auto-Completion, Demo Mode, Formula Assistance, Offline Assistance, and Configuration Validation)

## Overview
This update refines the CLI interface by combining interactive plotting command configuration with real-time formula assistance and robust configuration validation. In addition to a guided wizard, detailed command preview, and dynamic auto-completion, the enhanced CLI now integrates expression tracing, auto-correction, a chat module powered by the OpenAI API, and a new offline formula assistance fallback. These improvements reduce input errors, streamline user onboarding, and ensure reliable operation even under adverse network conditions, solidifying our mission to be the go-to plot library for formula visualisations.

## Interactive Guidance and Command Preview
- **Step-by-Step Prompts:** Provides detailed guidance for entering formulas, intervals, steps, and output options, alongside inline help and references to documentation.
- **Command Preview:** Displays a final command preview that allows users to review, edit, or cancel their input before execution, drastically reducing configuration mistakes.

## Auto-Completion and Assistance
- **Dynamic Suggestions:** Implements auto-completion for command options and flags using Node.js readline interface, enhanced by contextual suggestions based on past command history.
- **Formula Assistance Integration:** Supports flags such as `--trace` for detailed evaluation logs, `--autocorrect` for common formula error corrections, and `--chat` to launch an interactive help session via the OpenAI API.

## Offline Formula Assistance
- **Heuristic Analysis:** When network access is unavailable or the OpenAI API is unresponsive, the CLI automatically falls back to a local heuristic engine that employs pattern matching and regular expressions to detect common errors in mathematical expressions.
- **Actionable Suggestions:** Provides clear, actionable suggestions and corrections for typical mistakes, ensuring users receive assistance regardless of connectivity.
- **Seamless Integration:** Automatically activates the offline assistance mode without disrupting the user workflow.

## Demo Mode
- **Interactive Walkthrough:** A new `--demo` flag triggers a guided demonstration of key plotting commands, configuration steps, and output explanations.
- **Engagement for First-Time Users:** Designed to ease the learning curve by showcasing the toolâ€™s core capabilities in an interactive manner.

## Configuration Validation
- **Pre-Execution Checks:** Validates configuration sources including environment variables, JSON configuration files, and CLI arguments before executing commands.
- **Error Reporting:** Provides clear and actionable error messages to highlight inconsistencies or missing parameters.
- **Secure Defaults:** Utilizes secure fallback defaults to ensure a reliable experience for first-time users and minimize runtime errors.

## Additional Enhancements
- **User Session Logging:** Integrates lightweight logging of CLI sessions to help diagnose issues and improve future iterations.
- **Localized Help Messages:** Plans for multi-language support and localized prompts to further improve accessibility.
- **Enhanced Error Recovery:** Improves error detection and provides suggestions for quick recovery without interrupting the user flow.

## Implementation Details
- **CLI Parser Enhancements:** Extends the existing argument parser to support new flags (`--trace`, `--autocorrect`, `--chat`, `--demo`) and robust configuration validation.
- **Real-Time Input Handling:** Leverages Node.js libraries (e.g., readline) to capture user inputs, provide auto-completion, and trigger context-aware help and error messages during interactive sessions.
- **Integrated Chat Module:** Implements a lightweight chat interface that interacts with the OpenAI API, managed via environment variables.
- **Offline Assistance Engine:** Employs a heuristic-based engine that is automatically activated when the online API is unavailable, ensuring uninterrupted formula guidance.

## Testing and Documentation
- **Unit and Integration Tests:** Comprehensive testing covering interactive sessions, online and offline assistance, command preview functionality, and configuration validation scenarios.
- **Documentation Updates:** README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md are updated to include detailed usage examples, configuration guidelines, and troubleshooting steps for the enhanced CLI interface.

## Benefits
- **Enhanced Usability:** Consolidates guided command entry, real-time assistance, offline fallback support, and thorough configuration validation into a single, intuitive CLI experience.
- **Error Reduction:** Interactive prompts, command previews, and proactive validations significantly reduce the risk of misconfigurations and user errors.
- **Robustness and Reliability:** Ensures smooth operation even during network outages, with seamless fallback mechanisms and improved error recovery strategies.

## Summary
The updated CLI_INTERFACE feature offers a holistic, user-centric command line experience that integrates guided interaction, dynamic auto-completion, real-time and offline formula assistance, and stringent configuration validation. These enhancements not only promote ease of use and reliability but also align perfectly with our mission to be the definitive tool for formula visualisations.
