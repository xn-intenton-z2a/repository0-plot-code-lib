# CLI_INTERFACE Feature Specification (Enhanced with Guided Wizard, Command Preview, Auto-Completion, Demo Mode, and Formula Assistance)

## Overview
This feature refines the existing CLI interface by combining interactive plotting command configuration with real-time formula assistance. In addition to a guided wizard, detailed command preview, and robust auto-completion, this updated CLI now integrates expression tracing, auto-correction, and a chat module powered by the OpenAI API. This consolidation improves onboarding, reduces input errors, and provides on-demand formula help—all in a single user-friendly command line tool that reinforces our mission to be the go-to plot library for formula visualisations.

## Interactive Guidance and Command Preview
- **Step-by-Step Prompts:** Offers detailed guidance for entering formulas, intervals, steps, and output options with inline help and documentation references.
- **Command Preview:** Displays a final command preview, allowing users to review, edit, or cancel before execution to reduce configuration mistakes.

## Auto-Completion Enhancement
- **Dynamic Suggestions:** Implements auto-completion for command options and flags using the Node.js readline interface, enriched by past command history.
- **Context Awareness:** Provides intelligent suggestions based on common plotting scenarios and recent usage patterns.

## Demo Mode
- **Interactive Walkthrough:** A new CLI flag (`--demo`) triggers a guided demonstration showing key plotting commands, configuration steps, and output explanations.
- **First-Time User Engagement:** Designed to lower the learning curve and showcase the tool's core capabilities interactively.

## Formula Assistance Integration
- **Expression Tracing:** The CLI now supports a `--trace` flag to output detailed evaluation logs covering parsing, unit conversion, and intermediate calculations.
- **Auto-Correction:** With the `--autocorrect` flag, the tool suggests and previews corrections for common formula errors before execution.
- **Chat-Based Help:** Activating the `--chat` flag launches an interactive session that leverages the OpenAI API to provide real-time suggestions, debugging tips, and alternative formulations. This chat module is fully integrated into the CLI, offering both blocking sessions and optional hints during command input.

## Implementation Details
- **CLI Parser Enhancements:** Extend the existing argument parser to accommodate new flags (`--trace`, `--autocorrect`, and `--chat`) without disrupting current workflows.
- **Real-Time Input Handling:** Use Node.js libraries (e.g., readline) to capture user input, provide auto-completion, and trigger context-aware help during interactive sessions.
- **Integrated Chat Module:** Implement a lightweight module interfacing with the OpenAI API. Environment variables (via dotenv) store API keys, ensuring secure and configurable usage.
- **Documentation Updates:** Update README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md with comprehensive examples covering the enhanced interactive wizard and formula assistance features.

## Testing and Quality Assurance
- **Unit and Integration Tests:** Develop tests that simulate interactive sessions, verifying auto-complete accuracy, correct flag handling for tracing and auto-correction, and proper responses from the chat integration (by mocking API calls).
- **User Feedback Loop:** Monitor interactive sessions to refine guidance, command preview accuracy, and chat responsiveness.

## Benefits
- **Enhanced Usability:** Consolidates interactive plotting and real-time formula help into a single, intuitive CLI experience.
- **Error Reduction:** Guided prompts, command previews, and auto-correction support reduce input errors and misconfigurations.
- **Immediate Support:** On-demand chat assistance empowers users with context-aware debugging and alternative suggestions, making the tool more accessible to both new and experienced users.

## Summary
By merging formula assistance capabilities into the CLI interface, this updated feature streamlines user interaction and consolidates functionality. The enhanced interface supports guided command entry, dynamic auto-completion, interactive demos, and on-demand help—all aligned with our mission to be the go-to plot library for formula visualisations.
