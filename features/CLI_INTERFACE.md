# CLI_INTERFACE Feature Specification

## Overview
This unified feature replaces the separate CLI_PARSER and DOCUMENTATION features. It provides a robust command-line interface that not only parses and validates arguments with support for shorthand aliases and auto-completion but also delivers integrated, comprehensive help and usage documentation. This consolidation simplifies CLI-related development and maintenance, while ensuring consistent user guidance aligned with our mission to be a go-to plot library for formula visualisations.

## CLI Argument Parsing and Auto-Completion
- **Argument Mapping:**
  - Parses full-length flags (e.g., `--plot`, `--diagnostics`, `--export`, `--log`, `--json-log`, `--help`) as well as shorthand aliases (e.g., `-p`, `-d`, `-e`, `-l`, `-j`, `-h`).
  - Utilizes a configuration object to translate aliases into their full counterparts before delegating to feature-specific handlers (such as PLOT_ENGINE, DIAGNOSTICS, HTTP_API, and LOGGING).
  - Ensures robust validation and provides descriptive error messages for unrecognized or conflicting flags.

- **Auto-Completion Subsystem:**
  - Generates shell scripts for bash, zsh, and fish to enable auto-completion of CLI commands and flags.
  - Includes both full and shorthand flag suggestions, streamlining command input for improved usability.

## Integrated Documentation and Help
- **Dynamic Help Output:**
  - Consolidates help documentation for all CLI commands and flags, presenting detailed descriptions, usage examples, and troubleshooting tips.
  - Activated via the `--help` flag (or `-h`), the help message covers all aspects of the CLI, including argument parsing behavior, auto-completion installation procedures, and usage instructions for underlying features like HTTP_API and PLOT_ENGINE.

- **Synchronization with Repository Documentation:**
  - Ensures that the CLI help remains in sync with the repositoryâ€™s README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, and other documentation files.
  - Provides guidance on updating documentation alongside CLI changes in accordance with contribution guidelines.

## Testing and Quality Assurance
- **Unit and Integration Tests:**
  - Tests that simulate a variety of CLI inputs (full-length and shorthand) to ensure accurate mapping and parsing.
  - Auto-completion script generation tests to verify output correctness for different shell environments.
  - Help output tests to validate that the dynamic documentation accurately reflects the current feature set.

## Usage Examples
- **Standard CLI Usage:**
  - Run: `node src/lib/main.js --plot "sin(x)" --log`
  - Shorthand: `node src/lib/main.js -p "sin(x)" -l`

- **Auto-Completion:**
  - Generate auto-completion script: `node src/lib/main.js --generate-completion`

- **Help Display:**
  - Display dynamic help documentation: `node src/lib/main.js --help`

This consolidated CLI_INTERFACE feature enhances the overall developer and user experience by merging command parsing with integrated documentation, fostering a more maintainable and user-friendly CLI environment.
