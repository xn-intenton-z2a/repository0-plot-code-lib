# Tutorial

## Overview
This feature introduces an interactive tutorial mode to help new users understand the capabilities of the repository. The tutorial provides step-by-step guidance on how to generate plots, use various CLI options, and interpret diagnostic and output data. It aims to lower the barrier for entry by explaining the usage of different flags and providing sample commands.

## Key Objectives
- **Interactive Guidance:** When the CLI is invoked with a `--tutorial` flag, the application will enter a guided mode that explains each available command and feature interactively.
- **Comprehensive Walkthrough:** The tutorial will walk users through generating a basic plot, using diagnostics, entering interactive mode, and selecting different text output formats.
- **Usage Examples and Explanations:** Provide clear examples and explanations for all modes (CLI, web interface, and text outputs), helping users become familiar with the tool without referring to external documentation.
- **Improved Onboarding:** Enhance user onboarding by integrating contextual help and next-step suggestions as the user progresses through the tutorial.

## Design & Implementation
### CLI Integration (src/lib/main.js)
- Extend the CLI parser to detect the new `--tutorial` flag.
- When activated, the application will:
  - Display a welcome message explaining the purpose of the tutorial.
  - Sequentially present key commands and features, pausing for user confirmation before moving on.
  - Offer sample command executions directly in the console, with descriptions of expected outputs.

### User Interaction
- Provide prompts to allow users to navigate through the tutorial at their own pace.
- Implement error handling to catch any unexpected input during the tutorial and offer helpful guidance for correction.

### Documentation & Testing
- Update README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md to include sections on accessing and using the tutorial mode.
- Develop unit tests (e.g., in tests/unit/tutorial.test.js) to ensure that invoking `--tutorial` triggers the expected interactive sequence and that users can successfully complete the tutorial.

## Usage Examples
- **Activate Tutorial Mode:**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --tutorial
  ```
- **Expected Flow:**
  1. Display welcome and objective messages.
  2. Provide guided steps for generating a plot:
     ```bash
     node src/lib/main.js output.svg "quad:1,0,0,-10,10,1"
     ```
  3. Explain additional flags like `--interactive`, `--diagnostics`, and various text output flags.

By incorporating the TUTORIAL feature, the repository will better support newcomers by offering an intuitive introduction to its full range of plotting and diagnostic capabilities.
