# SCHEDULED_PLOTTING Feature Specification (Enhanced with Notification Integration)

## Overview
This updated feature refines the scheduling capabilities of the plotting library by automating plot generation and export processes while introducing an optional notification mechanism. In addition to supporting cron-like expressions and fixed time intervals, users can configure custom notification hooks to alert them upon success or failure of scheduled plot operations. This enhancement further aligns with our mission to be the go-to plot library for formula visualisations by improving user feedback and operational reliability.

## Implementation Details
- **Source File:** The scheduling logic remains encapsulated in a single source file (e.g., `src/lib/scheduledPlotting.js`).

- **CLI Integration:**
  - A new CLI flag (`--schedule`) accepts scheduling parameters including timing (via cron expressions or fixed intervals), plot template identifiers, export options, and now notification settings.
  - **Notification Settings:**
    - `--notify-command`: Allow users to specify a shell command to execute on successful plot generation.
    - `--notify-on-error`: Optionally trigger a notification command or log when a scheduled plot fails.

- **Scheduling Engine:**
  - Utilizes Node.js functions such as `setInterval` for fixed-interval scheduling.
  - Optionally integrates a lightweight cron parser for more advanced scheduling, ensuring minimal dependency overhead.

- **Plot Execution & Notification Workflow:**
  - Leverages the existing PLOT_ENGINE to generate or export plots automatically.
  - Upon successful execution, if a notification command is provided, it is executed to inform the user.
  - Includes robust error handling where failures are logged and the notification hook can alert users to issues, helping maintain continuous monitoring.

- **Configuration Flexibility:**
  - Users can provide scheduling and notification parameters via command-line arguments or through an external JSON configuration file.
  - Sensitive notification configurations (e.g., commands or endpoints) can be secured using environment variables.

## Testing and Documentation
- **Unit Tests:** Develop tests to simulate scheduled tasks, including triggering of notification commands for both successful executions and error scenarios.
- **Integration Tests:** Ensure that scheduled plotting with notifications operates seamlessly with CLI and HTTP API functionalities, particularly in multi-task environments.
- **Documentation Updates:**
  - Update README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md to include clear usage examples and configuration instructions for notification integration alongside scheduling parameters.
  - Provide troubleshooting guidelines in cases where notification actions fail or produce unexpected results.

## Benefits
- **Enhanced Automation:** Automates not only plot generation but also offers real-time feedback through notifications, reducing manual monitoring.
- **Improved Operational Insight:** By alerting users to both successes and failures, the feature supports proactive maintenance and better diagnostics.
- **Flexibility:** Users can tailor notification behavior to match various operational contexts (e.g., local scripts, external monitoring systems).

## Summary
The enhanced SCHEDULED_PLOTTING feature significantly improves the automation and reliability of the plotting library. With the introduction of configurable notifications, users gain timely insights into the execution status of their automated plots, thereby reinforcing our mission of providing a robust, user-friendly tool for formula visualisations.
