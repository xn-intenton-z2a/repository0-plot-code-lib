# SCHEDULED_PLOTTING Feature Specification

## Overview
This feature introduces scheduling capabilities to the plotting library, allowing users to automate the generation and export of plots at regular intervals. By supporting cron-like expressions or fixed time intervals, users can monitor trends and generate historical visual data without manual intervention, aligning with our mission to be the go-to plot library for formula visualisations.

## Implementation Details
- **Source File:** Implement scheduling logic in a single source file (e.g., `src/lib/scheduledPlotting.js`).
- **CLI Integration:** Introduce a new CLI flag (`--schedule`) that accepts scheduling parameters including timing (as cron expressions or intervals), plot template identifiers, and export options.
- **Scheduling Engine:** Use Node.js timing functions such as `setInterval` for fixed intervals or integrate a lightweight cron parser for more complex scheduling without adding heavy dependencies.
- **Plot Execution:** Leverage the existing PLOT_ENGINE to generate plots automatically when triggered. Generated plots can either be output to the console, saved as files, or forwarded to external systems.
- **Configuration:** Allow users to specify scheduling parameters via command-line arguments or an external JSON configuration file, ensuring flexibility and ease of use.
- **Failure Handling:** Implement robust error handling and logging to capture scheduling failures, so users are informed of any interruptions in automated tasks.

## Testing and Documentation
- **Unit Tests:** Create tests to simulate scheduled executions, ensuring that plots are generated correctly and exported as expected, while gracefully handling errors.
- **Integration Tests:** Verify that scheduled plotting operates seamlessly alongside existing CLI and HTTP API functionalities.
- **Documentation:** Update README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md with clear guidelines, usage examples, and configuration instructions for scheduled plotting.

## Benefits
- **Automation:** Removes repetitive manual execution by automating plot generation at desired intervals.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Enables users to regularly capture and track changes in visual data, supporting long-term monitoring and analysis.
- **Enhanced Productivity:** Frees up user time by eliminating the need to run plots manually, thereby streamlining workflows.

## Summary
The SCHEDULED_PLOTTING feature extends the plotting library's capabilities by automating plot generation and export processes. It provides an efficient, configurable scheduling mechanism that supports both simple and advanced scheduling needs, further reinforcing the mission of being the go-to tool for formula visualisations.
