# OVERVIEW
This update merges caching functionality into the core Plot Engine, enhancing the plotting capabilities with performance improvements. It not only retains advanced SVG customization features, marker support, gradient configuration, and curve smoothing, but it also integrates a caching mechanism to store and reuse computed plot data. This integration reduces redundant computations on repeated requests and improves responsiveness across both CLI and HTTP modes.

# IMPLEMENTATION
- Extend the configuration schema and interpolation routines to accept additional parameters for caching TTL and check period if needed.
- Update the SVG generation logic to merge new caching checks alongside the existing advanced plot features.
- On HTTP and CLI requests, generate a cache key based on the expression, range, smoothing, markers, and gradient details via JSON stringification.
- Before generating the SVG or computing plot details, check the cache for an existing valid result; if found, return the cached output immediately.
- If caching misses occur, compute the plot, save the result in cache with a sensible TTL (e.g., 60 seconds), and then return the computed result.
- Ensure error handling provides detailed feedback for invalid parameter values and clearly logs cache hits and misses while preserving previous validations on stroke styling, marker customization, and smoothing parameters.

# IMPACT
- Improved responsiveness by reusing plot computations for identical queries, reducing duplicated work.
- Enhanced user experience through faster plot generation in both HTTP and CLI modes.
- Consolidation of similar performance features reduces complexity by merging caching and plot engine capabilities into one cohesive feature.
- Aligns with the mission of providing a go-to plot library with high performance and expressive styling options without redundancy in the code base.
