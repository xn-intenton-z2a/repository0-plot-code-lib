# OVERVIEW
This update enhances the core Plot Engine by merging existing advanced SVG plotting capabilities with a new SVG minification option. When enabled via a CLI flag or HTTP query parameter (minify=true), the generated SVG output is automatically minified to remove superfluous whitespace and newlines. This reduces file size and transmission payload, improving performance for web delivery without sacrificing any style or accessibility features.

# IMPLEMENTATION
- Update the SVG plot generation routine in the main library (createSvgPlot function) to check for a new parameter called minify (available in customLabels or CLI options).
- If minify is set to true, post-process the generated SVG string by stripping extra whitespace, newlines, and redundant spaces between tags. Use simple string replacement methods to ensure that the output remains valid SVG while being compact.
- Ensure that the minification is applied only after all other dynamic features (e.g., marker support, gradient definitions, axis labels, and embedded metadata) are incorporated into the SVG.
- Update tests to verify that when the minify option is enabled, the returned SVG contains no extraneous whitespace and is significantly smaller in size compared to the regular output.
- Maintain backward compatibility so that if the minify flag is not provided the SVG will be returned as originally formatted.

# IMPACT
- Reduced SVG file sizes lead to faster transmission and quicker rendering in client applications.
- Enhances the libraryâ€™s suitability for web applications where bandwidth and load times are critical.
- Provides additional customization for end users interested in embedding streamlined graphics in production environments.
- Aligns with the mission of being the go-to plot library by offering both powerful visualization and performance optimizations in a single cohesive feature set.
