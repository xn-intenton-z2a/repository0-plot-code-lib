# PLOT_ENGINE

## Overview
This feature extends the core plotting module to not only support advanced expression parsing, asynchronous plot generation, robust caching, and detailed numerical analysis, but also to introduce a new gradient visualization capability. The gradient visualization will render plots with color gradients based on function values or derivative magnitudes, thereby enhancing visual differentiation across regions of rapid change.

## Key Objectives
- **Expression Parsing & Validation:**
  - Process and validate plot specification strings with prefixes like "quad:" and "expr:" using mathjs for both legacy and modern input protocols.
- **Enhanced Plot Generation:**
  - Support various plot types (quadratic, linear, trigonometric, polar, exponential, logarithmic, etc.) with asynchronous evaluation for responsive performance.
- **Advanced Analysis Integration:**
  - Compute area under the curve using the trapezoidal rule.
  - Approximate derivatives using finite differences.
  - Provide statistical metrics (mean, standard deviation, median, mode).
  - Perform data transformations such as rotation, reflection, scaling, inversion, and smoothing (moving average).
- **Gradient Visualization:**
  - Introduce gradient color mapping to emphasize regions of rapid change or significant function variation.
  - Allow customization of gradient parameters (e.g., color ranges, thresholds) to suit different types of plots.
- **Robust Logging & Caching:**
  - Leverage existing asynchronous processing and caching mechanisms to log both plotting and analysis operations, including the new gradient visualization outputs.

## Design & Implementation
### Parser and Evaluation
- Enhance the parser (e.g., `src/lib/parser.js`) to validate expressions and direct computed data to both numerical analysis and gradient visualization routines.
- Continue using mathjs for validation while adding helper functions to compute gradient metrics.

### Analysis and Visualization Routines
- **Numerical Analysis:**
  - Implement methods for area under curve, derivative approximation, and statistical computations.
  - Support data transformations inherently within the plotting process.
- **Gradient Visualization Module:**
  - Develop a new sub-module to compute gradient mappings based on the plotted data values or derivative measures.
  - Integrate this module with the plotting output to apply a color gradient overlay on the generated plots, enhancing visual cues.

### CLI and API Integration
- Update `src/lib/main.js` to accept additional flags or modifiers (e.g., `--gradient`) that trigger the gradient visualization routines alongside traditional plotting and analysis.
- Ensure seamless integration with logging and caching features to incorporate gradient output transparently.

### Testing and Documentation
- Extend unit tests (e.g., in `tests/unit/main.test.js` and new tests for gradient computations) to include scenarios covering gradient visual outputs.
- Update documentation (README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md) to include usage examples and configuration options for the gradient visualization feature.

## Usage Examples
- **Standard Plot Generation with Advanced Analysis:**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js output.svg "expr:Math.sin(x)*x:-10,10,0.5"
  ```

- **Plot with Gradient Visualization Enabled:**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js output_gradient.svg "expr:Math.sin(x)*x:-10,10,0.5 --gradient"
  ```

This enhanced PLOT_ENGINE feature aligns with the mission of being the go-to plot library by integrating advanced analytical tools and innovative visualization techniques into a single, cohesive module.
