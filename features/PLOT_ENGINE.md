# PLOT_ENGINE

## Overview
This feature is the core plotting and diagnostics engine of the repository. It provides robust plot generation, enhanced debug logging, and now, integrated advanced numerical analysis. This update builds on the existing plot generation functionality by enabling users to perform derivative calculations, area under the curve analysis, statistical computations, and geometric transformations directly within the plotting workflow.

## Key Objectives
- **Comprehensive Plot Generation:** Continue to support various plot types (quadratic, linear, sine, cosine, tangent, polar, exponential, logarithmic, etc.) with consistent parsing and visualization.
- **Enhanced Input Validation:** Utilize advanced parsing (using mathjs) to verify mathematical expressions and provide clear and actionable error messages.
- **Integrated Debug Logging:** Ensure detailed logging during plotting and analysis processes when the `--debug` flag is provided, covering formula parsing, computation steps, and intermediate data.
- **Advanced Numerical Analysis:** Introduce capabilities to compute derivatives, evaluate the area under a curve (using numerical integration such as the trapezoidal rule), and deliver basic statistical functions (average, standard deviation, median, mode) on plot data. Additionally, support transformations such as rotation, reflection, scaling, and inversion.
- **Multi-Modal Support:** Seamlessly handle plotting, debugging, and analysis across CLI commands, interactive REPL sessions, and the Express-based web interface.
- **Robust Error Diagnostics:** Augment error handling with detailed diagnostic feedback to aid users in quickly resolving issues.

## Design & Implementation
### Core Plotting and Analysis
- **Plot Generation:** Leverage the core plotting functions to process plot specifications and generate visual outputs, while integrating additional numerical analysis routines. 
- **Numerical Analysis Module:** Develop a lightweight module within PLOT_ENGINE that provides functions for derivative calculations, area estimation using numerical integration, and basic statistical computations on plot data. 
- **Transformation Functions:** Embed support for geometric transformations, allowing users to rotate, reflect, scale, or invert plots as part of the plotting process.
- **Debug Logging Enhancements:** When the `--debug` flag is active, provide verbose logs detailing all analysis steps, including raw input, intermediate results, and final computed outputs.

### CLI and API Integration
- **Flag Handling:** Enhance the CLI parser to support optional flags (e.g. `--analyze`) that trigger the advanced analysis routines alongside plot generation.
- **Unified Logger:** Continue using the unified logging component that outputs additional analysis data when debug mode is enabled.

### Testing & Quality Assurance
- **Unit Tests:** Extend the existing vitest suite to include tests for derivative calculations, area under curve estimations, transformation functions, and statistical summary calculations. 
- **Documentation Update:** Revise the README and CONTRIBUTING documents to detail new analysis features and provide usage examples.

## Usage Examples
- **Standard Plot Generation with Analysis:**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js output.svg "quad:1,0,0,-10,10,1" --analyze
  ```
- **Debug Mode with Advanced Analysis:**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js output.svg "sine:1,1,0,0,360,30" --debug --analyze
  ```
- **Interactive Mode with Analysis Enabled:**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --interactive --analyze
  ```

This enhanced PLOT_ENGINE consolidates robust plot generation with advanced numerical analysis and transformation capabilities, aligning with the repository's mission of being the go-to tool for versatile and comprehensive mathematical visualizations.
