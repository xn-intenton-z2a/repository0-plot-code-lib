# OVERVIEW
This update enhances the core Plot Engine functionality by retaining all previous improvements (advanced stroke styling, marker customization, extended gradient configurations, smooth curve generation, and dynamic configuration merging) and adding explicit SVG accessibility enhancements. The new accessibility features ensure that the generated SVGs are compliant with best practices for assistive technology support.

# ACCESSIBILITY ENHANCEMENTS
- A new <title> element is injected as the first child of the SVG. The title element includes a unique identifier (generated using a timestamp or similar approach) and contains descriptive text provided via an optional parameter (e.g., svgTitle).
- Optionally, a <desc> element can be added when a descriptive text parameter (e.g., svgDesc) is provided. This description aids screen readers further.
- The SVG element is updated to include an aria-labelledby attribute that references the IDs of the <title> (and <desc> if available), ensuring that screen readers can correctly announce the purpose and content of the plot.
- These accessibility improvements are integrated without affecting the existing customizations such as dynamic stroke attributes, marker definitions, color gradients, and smoothing capabilities.

# IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
- Modify the createSvgPlot function to prepend a <title> element with a unique id to the SVG output. Optionally add a <desc> element if a description is provided through CLI or configuration.
- Update the SVG tag to include an aria-labelledby attribute referencing the title (and description) IDs.
- Ensure the new accessibility elements are inserted before other SVG child elements (such as <defs> or shape elements) to adhere to SVG best practices.
- Maintain backward compatibility so that if no accessibility parameters are provided, the SVG remains unchanged except for the inclusion of a default title element.

# IMPACT
- Improves accessibility compliance for users with visual impairments and ensures that the plots are announced correctly by screen readers.
- Aligns the plot output with industry best practices as outlined in SVG accessibility guidelines, contributing to a more inclusive user experience.
