# OVERVIEW
This update expands the existing plot engine functionality by integrating advanced SVG customization features. In addition to supporting bulk export of multiple plots, it now offers enhanced stroke styling, marker customization, and extended gradient configuration. These improvements provide users detailed control over plot aesthetics including stroke width, dash patterns and line caps, as well as the ability to include custom markers and multi-stop gradients. Overall, this enhancement deepens the library's core plotting capability while maintaining CLI and HTTP generation modes.

# IMPLEMENTATION
- Extend the configuration schema and interpolation routines to accept new parameters such as strokeWidth, strokeDashArray, strokeLinecap, markerStart, markerEnd, markerShape, markerWidth, markerHeight, and markerFill.
- Update the SVG generation logic to:
  - Apply stroke style attributes (stroke-width, stroke-dasharray, stroke-linecap) when provided and validate these inputs.
  - Include marker definitions in the SVG <defs> section when markerStart or markerEnd is enabled, using default marker paths or custom parameters.
  - Incorporate extended gradient support by processing a JSON string of gradientStops and falling back to gradientStartColor and gradientEndColor if not provided.
  - Maintain support for curve smoothing via a smoothingFactor parameter that adjusts quadratic Bezier curve controls.
- Ensure error handling provides detailed feedback if invalid values (e.g., negative strokeWidth or empty strokeDashArray) are submitted.
- Update CLI and HTTP endpoint logic to parse and incorporate the new parameters and pass them to the SVG rendering functions. Modify Zod schemas in the configuration loader to validate additional numeric and enumerated fields for stroke and marker customization.
- Update tests in the unit test suite to cover scenarios for new stroke parameters, marker configurations, and extended gradient stops. This ensures robust quality assurance for both command line and HTTP API modes.

# IMPACT
- Enhanced user control over plot aesthetics improves the expressiveness of visualizations.
- Detailed customization allows plots to be tailored for publication-quality graphics, meeting diverse user requirements.
- The added features align with the mission of making the library the go-to tool for visualizing mathematical formulas and time series data, fulfilling both simplicity and flexibility in core functionality.
