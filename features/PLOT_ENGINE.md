# PLOT_ENGINE

## Overview
This feature remains the core plotting and numerical analysis module while incorporating significant enhancements to expression parsing, validation, and plot history management. In addition to processing both legacy and modern plot specification strings, the updated PLOT_ENGINE now leverages asynchronous evaluation, improved error handling, and an enhanced caching system for plot history. These improvements ensure robust operation and deliver detailed feedback to users in real-time.

## Key Objectives
- **Expression Parsing & Validation:**
  - Process plot specification strings prefixed with modes such as "quad:" and "expr:".
  - Utilize mathjs for syntactic and semantic validation, ensuring robust evaluation and meaningful error messages on failure.
- **Enhanced Plot Generation:**
  - Support traditional and extended plot types including quadratic, linear, trigonometric, polar, exponential, and logarithmic plots.
  - Implement asynchronous evaluation for heavy computations, reducing input-to-output latency.
- **Plot History Caching:**
  - Introduce an improved caching layer that asynchronously logs every plot request, save plot specification, timestamp, and summary metadata in a dedicated local file.
  - Allow retrieval via a CLI flag (e.g. `--history`) with enhanced formatting and optional cache expiration controls.
- **Robust Logging & Debug Support:**
  - Expand logging to include detailed information on parsing results, asynchronous processing outcomes, and caching operations.
  - Integrate with existing CLI flags to ensure errors and important events are logged with sufficient context for troubleshooting.

## Design & Implementation
### Expression Processing
- Develop a parser module (e.g., `src/lib/parser.js`) that interprets plot specifications, handling multiple prefixes and ensuring backward compatibility.
- Integrate mathjs for both immediate validation and asynchronous evaluation to cater for computation-heavy expressions.

### Asynchronous Processing & Caching
- Update the main plotting routine to perform asynchronous computations where applicable, especially for complex expressions.
- Enhance the caching mechanism to write plot history records asynchronously, ensuring non-blocking operations during high usage.
- Add optional settings (e.g., expiration or manual cache clearing) to improve long-term usability.

### CLI & Debug Integration
- Modify `src/lib/main.js` to recognize the new asynchronous processing enhancements without altering the existing user interface.
- Ensure that the `--history` flag prints a detailed log of past plots, including enhanced metadata.
- Include robust error detection and logging that captures both synchronous and asynchronous failures.

## Usage Examples
- **Generating a Plot:**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js output.svg "quad:1,0,0,-10,10,1"
  ```
- **Custom Mathematical Expression:**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js output.svg "expr:Math.sin(x)*x:-10,10,0.5"
  ```
- **Retrieving Plot History:**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --history
  ```

## Future Considerations
- Extend asynchronous processing further to support parallel evaluations on multi-core systems.
- Incorporate user-defined cache management options, such as cache expiration and manual purging.
- Continue to refine error logging to cover emerging edge cases in complex mathematical expression evaluations.

This enhancement to the PLOT_ENGINE not only maintains existing functionalities but also improves performance, user feedback, and scalability for more demanding plotting tasks.
