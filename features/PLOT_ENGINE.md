# OVERVIEW
This update consolidates and extends core plotting functionality. In addition to previous stroke styling, marker customization, curve smoothing, dynamic gradient configurations, automated accessibility improvements, and environment-aware configuration, the updated Plot Engine now supports enhanced stroke styling options (custom stroke width, dash patterns, and line cap styles) and advanced marker customization (start and end markers with configurable shape, dimensions, and fill color). This update also improves dynamic dimension handling and extended gradient stops support for visually rich plots.

# IMPLEMENTATION
- Update the createSvgPlot function to incorporate additional query parameters for stroke styling: strokeWidth, strokeDashArray, and strokeLinecap. These parameters are validated and then applied as additional attributes on the SVG elements.
- Enhance marker customization by adding support for markerStart and markerEnd along with markerShape, markerWidth, markerHeight, and markerFill. Markers are defined in the SVG defs and then associated with the plot path through the marker-start and marker-end attributes.
- Extend gradient configuration to support a JSON array of gradient stops. In the absence of explicit stops, fallback gradient settings (using gradientStartColor and gradientEndColor) are applied.
- Ensure that dynamic dimensions (width and height) are correctly mapped from configuration and CLI flags. The SVG viewBox and coordinate transformation logic are updated to reflect custom dimensions.
- Maintain comprehensive error handling: verifying valid numeric values for all new parameters, graceful error messages for faulty gradient stops or marker definitions, and preserving backward compatibility.
- Accessibility enhancements remain intact, including the injection of ARIA labelled text elements and ensuring that the first child of the SVG is a title element with unique identification.

# IMPACT
- Provides users with greater control over visual plot styling, enabling customized stroke appearances and marker placements.
- Enhances the visual quality of plots through advanced gradient stops and smooth transitions with curve smoothing.
- Improves the overall user experience and accessibility compliance for generated SVG plots.
- Consolidates feature improvements ensuring maintenance and further extensions can be made in a single, consistent repository module.
