# OWL_ENDPOINTS

## Overview
This feature provides a centralized configuration for public endpoint URLs specifically designed to request data for conversion to OWL (Web Ontology Language). By integrating this feature, users and developers can readily access reliable endpoints necessary for converting data into OWL format, enhancing interoperability and opening possibilities for semantic data applications.

## API Integration
- A dedicated module (e.g., `src/lib/owlEndpoints.js`) will export a constant object containing key-value pairs, where keys represent descriptive names and values are the actual URL endpoints.
- Example endpoints:
  - `CONVERTER_PRIMARY`: `https://api.owlconverter.org/v1/convert`
  - `CONVERTER_SECONDARY`: `https://ontology.example.com/convert`

## Implementation
- Create a new source file `src/lib/owlEndpoints.js` that defines and exports the endpoints as constants.
- Optionally, integrate with the CLI by providing a flag (e.g., `--owl-endpoints`) that prints the available endpoints.
- Ensure that the endpoints are immutable and documented within the code for maintenance clarity.

## Usage
- As a Library:
  ```js
  import { OWL_ENDPOINTS } from '@src/lib/owlEndpoints.js';
  console.log(OWL_ENDPOINTS.CONVERTER_PRIMARY);
  ```
- Via CLI (if implemented):
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --owl-endpoints
  ```

## Testing & Documentation
- Add unit tests in a new test file (e.g., `tests/unit/owlEndpoints.test.js`) to verify that the endpoints are correctly exported and match expected URL formats.
- Update the README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md with usage examples and integration details for OWL endpoint conversion.

## Future Considerations
- Allow customization via environment variables to override default endpoints.
- Implement error handling in case the endpoints become unreachable, and possibly add a health-check mechanism.
