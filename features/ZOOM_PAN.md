# ZOOM_PAN Feature Specification

## Description
This feature introduces interactive zoom and pan capabilities to the plotting library, with a primary focus on enhancing the user experience in the web interface. Users will be able to zoom into, and pan across, detailed sections of their plots for more granular inspection of data. This capability will be implemented as an overlay on existing plot renderings (such as SVG or HTML canvases) and will support both mouse and touch interactions.

## Motivation
- **Enhanced Data Exploration:** Enables users to focus on specific regions of interest by zooming in, and to navigate larger plots by panning. This is particularly useful for complex or high-density visualizations.
- **Interactive Analysis:** Provides a more dynamic and responsive environment for data analysis, complementing features like interactive legends and custom themes.
- **Mission Alignment:** Reinforces our goal to be the go-to tool for formula-based visualizations by delivering a modern, user-friendly interaction model that enhances data storytelling.

## Implementation Details
1. **Web Interface Integration:**
   - Extend the current web interface to incorporate zoom and pan functionality using native JavaScript event listeners (e.g., mouse wheel, pinch-to-zoom, drag events).
   - Modify the SVG/HTML rendering pipeline to adjust the viewBox or canvas transformations dynamically based on user interactions.
   - Ensure smooth transitions and limit zoom levels to prevent loss of context or performance issues.

2. **CLI and Configuration Options:**
   - Although primarily web-focused, include optional CLI flags to activate a basic zoom/pan mode if the output format supports interactivity (e.g., interactive SVGs).
   - Allow configuration of default zoom levels, pan sensitivity, and reset options via command-line parameters or configuration files.

3. **Testing and Documentation:**
   - Develop unit and integration tests to simulate user interactions such as zoom in, zoom out, and pan actions. Use headless browser testing for web interface validations.
   - Update README and CONTRIBUTING documents with detailed instructions, usage examples, and troubleshooting tips, ensuring consistency with other interactive features like interactive legends.

## Usage
- **Web Interface Example:**
  - Launch the web server using `npm run start:web`.
  - Navigate to the plot view and use the mouse wheel or pinch gestures to zoom, and click-drag to pan.
  - A reset button should be available to revert to the default view.

- **CLI Example (Interactive SVG):**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --interactive --zoom-pan output.svg "scatter:1,2;3,4;5,6;7,8"
  ```
  (Note: This mode renders an SVG with embedded interactivity controls for zooming and panning.)
