# CHAT_ISSUES Feature Specification

## Description
This updated feature integrates a Chat Completions API into the plotting tool to automatically convert natural language prompts into detailed, well-structured GitHub issues. It builds on the existing implementation by enabling iterative dialogue and enhanced customization of issue templates. The generated issues include complete implementation instructions, testing guidelines, and documentation updates in line with the CONTRIBUTING guidelines and our mission.

## Motivation
- **Streamlined Issue Management:** Automate the creation of detailed GitHub issues directly from user prompts, minimizing manual overhead and ensuring consistency.
- **Iterative Refinement:** Allow users to engage in a conversation with the tool, refining issues iteratively until they are precise and actionable.
- **Enhanced Quality and Consistency:** Maintain uniformity in issue formatting and content, supporting high-quality contributions that align with our mission to be the go-to plot library for formula-based visualisations.

## Implementation Details
1. **CLI and Web Interface Integration:**
   - Introduce a dedicated flag (e.g., `--chat`) for the CLI and a corresponding section in the web interface where users can submit natural language prompts.
   - Ensure that user inputs are sanitized and validated to meet security and formatting standards.

2. **Chat Completions API Integration:**
   - Utilize the OpenAI package to send user prompts along with repository context (extracted from CONTRIBUTING.md and MISSION.md) to generate structured GitHub issue drafts.
   - Secure API credentials via environment variables and implement robust error handling for connectivity and authentication issues.

3. **Issue Generation and Formatting:**
   - Parse the response from the Chat Completions API to construct a list of actionable GitHub issues. Each issue will include a title, detailed description, and categorized action items (implementation, testing, documentation).
   - Support output formats in both Markdown and JSON, enabling seamless integration with GitHub workflows and other project management tools.

4. **Enhanced Customization and Iteration:**
   - Allow users to customize issue templates, including tone, formatting, and metadata (labels, priority tags) directly through the prompt or via configuration files.
   - Provide an iterative refinement mode where users can send follow-up prompts to adjust or further detail the generated issues.
   - Log interactions for debugging and continuous improvement of the issue generation process.

5. **Testing and Documentation:**
   - Develop comprehensive unit and integration tests to simulate API interactions and verify that all generated issues adhere to repository standards.
   - Update the README and CONTRIBUTING guidelines with detailed usage examples, configuration instructions, and troubleshooting tips specific to the CHAT_ISSUES feature.

## Usage
- **CLI Example:**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --chat "Add modular API for real-time data transformation with iterative refinement for user feedback."
  ```
- **Web Interface Example:**
   - Navigate to the dedicated chat-based issue generation section in the web interface.
   - Submit a descriptive prompt and review the structured GitHub issues generated by the system, with options to refine them further.
