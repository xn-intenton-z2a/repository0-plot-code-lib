# CHAT_ISSUES Feature Specification

## Description
This feature integrates a Chat Completions API into the plotting library to automatically generate GitHub issues from user-supplied natural language prompts. It streamlines project management by converting descriptive inputs into structured, actionable issues that adhere to our CONTRIBUTING.md guidelines and support our mission of being the go-to plot library for formula-based visualisations.

## Motivation
- **Automated Issue Generation:** Reduce manual effort by transforming conceptual ideas into well-structured GitHub issues automatically.
- **Consistency and Quality:** Ensure that all generated issues are formatted according to our repository standards and include detailed implementation suggestions.
- **Enhanced Project Planning:** Assist developers and project managers in prioritizing tasks and improving workflow integration with GitHub.

## Implementation Details
1. **CLI Integration:**
   - Introduce a new CLI flag (e.g., `--chat`) that accepts a natural language prompt as an argument.
   - Extend the argument parser in `src/lib/main.js` to detect the flag and route execution to the Chat Issues module.

2. **Chat Completions API Integration:**
   - Utilize the `openai` package to send requests to the Chat Completions API. Construct the API request by combining the user prompt with contextual guidelines from CONTRIBUTING.md and MISSION.md.
   - Secure API credentials using environment variables (via `dotenv`) and add robust error handling for network or authentication failures.

3. **Issue Generation and Formatting:**
   - Parse the Chat Completions API response to extract a list of structured GitHub issues. Each issue should have a title, a detailed description, and optional metadata such as labels or priority tags.
   - Provide options for output in JSON or Markdown format to facilitate seamless integration with GitHub's issue import pipelines.
   - Ensure that the generated issues include implementation suggestions, testing guidelines, and documentation updates when necessary.

4. **Integration with Existing Pipelines:**
   - Validate that the generated issues conform to our current project structure and user documentation, integrating with our GitHub workflow for automated issue tracking and management.
   - Maintain comprehensive logs and error messages to aid debugging and ensure reliable operation.

5. **Testing and Documentation:**
   - Develop unit and integration tests (using Vitest) to simulate API responses and validate the complete flow from prompt submission to output generation.
   - Update the README and CONTRIBUTING documentation with clear instructions, usage examples, and a FAQ section covering common troubleshooting scenarios.

## Usage
- **CLI Example:**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --chat "Improve plotting performance for large datasets and add modular extensions for future plot types."
  ```
- **Expected Behavior:**
   - The tool sends the supplied prompt to the Chat Completions API and returns a list of structured GitHub issues in the terminal or an output file.
   - Each issue includes a title, description, and actionable suggestions designed to improve code quality, modularity, and test coverage.
