# CHAT_ISSUES Feature Specification

## Description
This feature integrates an AI-driven Chat Completions API into the plotting tool to automatically generate well-structured GitHub issue drafts. Users can submit natural language prompts that describe new functionalities, improvements, or bug reports, and the tool responds by producing actionable issue templates. These templates include a concise title, detailed descriptions, step-by-step implementation instructions, testing guidelines, and suggestions for documentation updates. The feature also supports an iterative dialogue process, allowing users to refine the generated drafts interactively.

## Motivation
- **Streamlined Issue Management:** Automates the creation of GitHub issues based on user prompts, reducing manual overhead and ensuring consistency with repository standards.
- **Enhanced Developer Workflow:** Facilitates a conversational process where users can refine issue details in a step-by-step manner, resulting in higher quality issue submissions.
- **Mission Alignment:** Reinforces our mission to be the go-to plot library by integrating modern, AI-powered development workflows alongside our advanced visualization capabilities.

## Implementation Details
1. **API Integration and Input Processing:**
   - Introduce a CLI flag (e.g., `--chat`) and a dedicated section in the web interface for submitting natural language prompts.
   - Sanitize and enrich user inputs using contextual information extracted from core project documents such as README, CONTRIBUTING, and MISSION.

2. **Chat Completions Engine:**
   - Securely connect to the Chat Completions API, managing API keys and adhering to rate limits.
   - Parse API responses to extract structured data including issue title, detailed description, implementation steps, testing strategies, and documentation recommendations.
   - Log all interactions to enable users to review and revise the generated issues if necessary.

3. **Iterative Dialogue and Customization:**
   - Enable follow-up prompts for further refinement of issue details, such as adjusting labels, priorities, and additional metadata.
   - Support interactive editing directly from the CLI output and within the web interface, making it easy for users to modify draft issues before final submission.

4. **CLI and Web Interface Enhancements:**
   - For CLI users, display the generated issue draft in the terminal with options for editing or saving as a Markdown file.
   - For web users, provide an interactive editor with inline help and tooltips, ensuring that the issue drafting process is intuitive and user-friendly.

5. **Testing and Documentation:**
   - Develop unit and integration tests to simulate various input scenarios and ensure that generated issues adhere to repository standards.
   - Update the README and CONTRIBUTING documentation with comprehensive guidelines and usage examples for the CHAT_ISSUES feature.

## Usage
- **CLI Example:**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --chat "Add support for real-time data filtering with interactive legends."
  ```
- **Web Interface Example:**
   - Navigate to the chat issue generation section in the web UI.
   - Enter a descriptive prompt and interactively refine the generated issue draft before submission to GitHub.
