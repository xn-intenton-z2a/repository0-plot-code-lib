# CHAT_ISSUES Feature Specification

## Description
This feature adds a Chat Completions integration that leverages our existing OpenAI dependency to generate a series of GitHub issues based on a natural language prompt. Users or automated systems can supply a detailed description of improvements, bug fixes, or new capabilities and receive a structured series of issues that can be further refined and iteratively implemented. This integration streamlines project management and feature planning, ensuring that the generated issues adhere to the standards outlined in our CONTRIBUTING.md and align with the mission of being the go-to plot library for formulae visualisations.

## Motivation
- **Streamlined Issue Generation:** Automate the creation of GitHub issues directly from a natural language prompt to reduce manual effort and ensure consistency in issue reporting.
- **Enhanced Project Planning:** Provide a structured output with details such as titles, descriptions, and implementation suggestions, aiding developers in prioritizing and managing tasks.
- **Quality & Consistency:** Leverage guidelines from CONTRIBUTING.md and principles from MISSION.md to ensure that each generated issue meets our high-quality standards and supports diverse plotting capabilities.

## Implementation Details
1. **CLI Integration:**
   - Introduce a new CLI flag (e.g., `--chat`) to activate Chat Issues mode.
   - Accept an additional argument that contains a natural language prompt describing the desired improvements or features.
   - Ensure that the argument parser in `src/lib/main.js` correctly routes this flag to the Chat Issues module.

2. **Chat Completions API Integration:**
   - Utilize the existing `openai` package to send requests to the Chat Completions API.
   - Construct requests that incorporate the user's prompt along with our project guidelines from CONTRIBUTING.md and MISSION.md to generate issues that are relevant and actionable.
   - Manage sensitive API credentials using environment variables (e.g., via dotenv) and include proper error handling for authentication and API failures.

3. **Issue Generation and Formatting:**
   - Parse the Chat Completions API response to extract a series of structured GitHub issues, ensuring each issue includes a title, a brief description, and implementation suggestions.
   - Enhance the output format to optionally include additional fields such as suggested labels, milestones, or priority tags, facilitating smoother integration with GitHub's workflow.
   - Provide an option to output the generated issues in either JSON or Markdown format for easy review and import.

4. **Integration with Existing Pipelines:**
   - Ensure the generated issues are compatible with our current GitHub integration pipeline, supporting automated use with GitHub's issue import tools or further processing via templating.
   - Maintain consistency with the project structure and update relevant documentation (README and CONTRIBUTING.md) with usage examples and troubleshooting tips.

5. **Testing and Documentation:**
   - Develop unit tests mocking API responses to validate the end-to-end flow from prompt submission to structured issue output.
   - Create integration tests to verify that the CLI flag triggers the Chat Issues workflow and that error messages are clear in the event of API failures or malformed prompts.
   - Update the repository documentation to include clear instructions, examples, and a FAQ for using the Chat Issues feature.

## Usage
- **CLI Example:**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --chat "Improve plotting performance for large datasets and add modular extensions for future plot types."
  ```
- **Expected Behavior:**
   - The tool sends the provided prompt to the Chat Completions API.
   - A series of potential GitHub issues is generated and returned in the terminal (or optionally saved to a file), covering aspects such as performance improvements, modular code structure, and test coverage enhancements.
   - The output is formatted for easy review and subsequent integration into the GitHub workflow.
