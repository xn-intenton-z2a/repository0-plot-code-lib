# CHAT_ISSUES Feature Specification

## Description
This feature integrates a Chat Completions API into our plotting tool to automatically generate GitHub issues from natural language prompts. Users can provide descriptive ideas that are transformed into well-structured, actionable issues formatted in strict adherence with our CONTRIBUTING guidelines and overall mission. This automation streamlines project management and enhances developer workflow, ensuring that each issue carries detailed implementation suggestions, testing guidelines, and documentation updates.

## Motivation
- **Automated Issue Creation:** Minimizes manual intervention by converting conceptual prompts into fully fleshed-out GitHub issues.
- **Consistency & Quality:** Ensures every generated issue follows our repository standards, boosting clarity and uniformity across development tasks.
- **Enhanced Developer Experience:** Improves productivity by integrating directly with the CLI and, where applicable, the web interface, supporting our mission to be the go-to plotting tool for formula-based visualisations.

## Implementation Details
1. **CLI Integration:**
   - Introduce a new CLI flag (e.g., `--chat`) that accepts a natural language prompt.
   - Update the argument parser in `src/lib/main.js` to recognize the `--chat` flag and route execution to the Chat Issues module.
   - Sanitize and validate the user prompt before API submission.

2. **Chat Completions API Integration:**
   - Utilize the `openai` package to send requests to the Chat Completions API.
   - Construct the request payload by incorporating the user prompt alongside contextual guidelines from CONTRIBUTING.md and MISSION.md.
   - Secure API credentials using environment variables (via `dotenv`) and implement robust error handling for network or authentication failures.

3. **Issue Generation and Formatting:**
   - Parse the API response to extract a list of structured GitHub issues. Each issue should include a title, a detailed description, and optional metadata such as labels or priority tags.
   - Offer output options in both Markdown and JSON formats to ensure seamless integration with GitHub’s issue pipelines.
   - Log all API interactions with detailed error messages to aid in debugging and future enhancements.

4. **Pipeline and Integration Considerations:**
   - Ensure that the generated issues conform to our repository’s established structure, incorporating implementation hints, testing directives, and documentation updates.
   - Enable easy integration with GitHub’s automated issue tracking workflows, maintaining a clear log for audit purposes.

5. **Testing and Documentation:**
   - Develop comprehensive unit and integration tests (using Vitest) to simulate API responses and verify the complete flow from prompt submission to issue generation.
   - Update the README and CONTRIBUTING documentation with illustrative usage examples, configuration examples, and troubleshooting guidelines.

## Usage
- **CLI Example:**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --chat "Improve plotting performance for large datasets and add modular extensions for future plot types."
  ```
- **Expected Behavior:**
  - The tool sends the provided prompt to the Chat Completions API and returns a structured list of GitHub issues.
  - Each issue includes a clear title, a detailed description, and actionable suggestions for developers to iterate upon, maintaining consistency with our overall mission and code quality standards.
