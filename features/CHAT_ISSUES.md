# CHAT_ISSUES Feature Specification

## Description
This feature integrates a Chat Completions API into the plotting tool to streamline the creation and refinement of GitHub issue drafts. Users can submit natural language prompts describing new functionalities, improvements, or bug reports, and the system will generate detailed issue templates. These templates include an actionable title, step-by-step implementation instructions, testing guidelines, and documentation updates. The process supports an iterative dialogue, enabling users to refine and finalize issues interactively.

## Motivation
- **Streamlined Issue Management:** Automatically convert descriptive prompts into well-structured GitHub issues, reducing manual overhead.
- **Iterative Refinement:** Allow users to interactively refine the generated issues, ensuring they meet repository standards and align with the project mission.
- **Enhanced Documentation:** Integrate project context (from CONTRIBUTING.md and MISSION.md) into issue drafts to maintain consistency and clarity.

## Implementation Details
1. **API Integration and Input Processing:**
   - Introduce a CLI flag (e.g., `--chat`) and a dedicated web interface section for submitting natural language prompts.
   - Sanitize and enrich user inputs with contextual information from core project documents.

2. **Chat Completions Engine:**
   - Connect securely to the Chat Completions API using managed credentials.
   - Parse the API responses to extract actionable GitHub issue drafts and present them in Markdown and JSON formats.

3. **Iterative Dialogue and Customization:**
   - Support follow-up prompts to refine issue titles, descriptions, and metadata (labels, priorities, etc.).
   - Log all interactions to allow users to review and revert changes if necessary.

4. **CLI and Web Interface Enhancements:**
   - For the CLI, output generated issue drafts directly to the terminal with options for immediate editing.
   - In the web interface, provide an interactive editor where users can adjust the issue details before final submission.

5. **Testing and Documentation:**
   - Develop comprehensive unit and integration tests to simulate various natural language inputs and verify that generated issues conform to repository standards.
   - Update the README and CONTRIBUTING documentation with clear usage examples and troubleshooting guidelines.

## Usage
- **CLI Example:**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --chat "Add support for real-time data filtering with interactive legends."
  ```

- **Web Interface Example:**
   - Navigate to the chat issue generation section, input your descriptive prompt, and interactively refine the generated GitHub issue draft before submission.
