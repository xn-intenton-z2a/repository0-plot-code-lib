# PLOT_ANIMATIONS Feature

## Overview
This feature introduces dynamic, animated plot rendering to enhance the visual experience of our plotting library. By leveraging simple ASCII/terminal animations for CLI users and smooth animated transitions for web interfaces, users can visualize changes and transitions in plot data over time. 

## Key Features
- **Animated Rendering:**
  - In CLI mode, display animated ASCII plots that update in real time. 
  - In the web interface, integrate animated transitions using Server Sent Events (SSE) and lightweight JavaScript to render smooth plot updates.
- **Synchronization with Core Engine:**
  - The animation routines will re-use existing plot data and configuration from the CORE_ENGINE, ensuring consistent aesthetic and diagnostic details.
- **Configurable Animation Options:**
  - Allow users to set parameters such as frame rate, duration, and transition effects through both command-line flags and JSON-based configuration.
  - Provide default settings that deliver a smooth visual experience while allowing experimental customizations.

## Integration
- **With CORE_ENGINE:**
  - Extract plot data and theme settings from the CORE_ENGINE to drive the animations.
  - Ensure seamless fallback to still images if the terminal or browser environment does not support animations.
- **With USER_INTERFACE (Merged CLI_ASSIST & WEB_API):**
  - Extend the interactive CLI wizard and web API endpoints to include options for activating animations.
  - Provide real-time control (e.g., start, pause, resume) via additional flags or endpoint parameters.

## Implementation Roadmap
1. **Library Module:**
   - Develop a single source file (e.g., `src/lib/plotAnimations.js`) that encapsulates the animation routines.
   - Implement both ASCII-based animation for CLI and an integration layer for web animated transitions.
2. **CLI Integration:**
   - Update the merged USER_INTERFACE to recognize an `--animate` flag that triggers the animated plot rendering.
   - Provide optional parameters for frame rate and duration using numeric parameter parsing.
3. **Web API Integration:**
   - Enhance the existing SSE endpoint to support animated status updates, including incremental plot frames.
   - Document usage examples and update README accordingly.
4. **Testing and Documentation:**
   - Write unit and integration tests to validate animation frame rendering in both environments.
   - Update CONTRIBUTING.md and README.md to incorporate development and usage guidelines for animated plots.

## Benefits
- **Enhanced Visualization:** Users gain a richer plot experience with real-time transitions and updates.
- **User Engagement:** Animated plots can make tool interactions more engaging and intuitive, promoting ease-of-use.
- **Unified Experience:** Aligns with our mission to be the visual go-to tool for formulae visualizations by merging advanced plotting with interactive control.
