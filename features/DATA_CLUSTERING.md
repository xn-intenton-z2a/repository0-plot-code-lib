# DATA_CLUSTERING Feature Specification

## Description
This feature introduces automated data clustering capabilities into the plotting library. By integrating clustering algorithms such as k-means and DBSCAN, users can automatically detect groups or clusters within their datasets. The identified clusters can be overlaid on scatter plots or other visualizations to highlight patterns and data segmentation. This provides advanced analytical insights without requiring external statistical tools.

## Motivation
- **Enhanced Data Analysis:** Automatically identify and visualize intrinsic data groupings to help users quickly uncover relationships and trends in large datasets.
- **User Empowerment:** Embed sophisticated clustering methods within the tool, making it a more comprehensive solution for exploratory data analysis.
- **Mission Alignment:** Supports our mission by extending the formula-based visualization toolbox, turning raw data into actionable insights with minimal user intervention.

## Implementation Details
1. **CLI Integration:**
   - Introduce a new CLI flag (e.g., `--cluster`) to enable clustering mode.
   - Allow users to specify the clustering algorithm (e.g., k-means, DBSCAN) and relevant parameters (e.g., number of clusters for k-means, epsilon and minimum samples for DBSCAN) as part of the command-line arguments.
   - Validate and parse these parameters, integrating them into the existing numeric validation routines.

2. **Data Processing Pipeline:**
   - Leverage existing data import and filtering functionalities to prepare datasets for clustering.
   - Use established clustering libraries or integrate with `mathjs` where applicable to perform clustering operations on the given dataset.
   - Process the resulting cluster labels and attach them to each data point for visualization purposes.

3. **Rendering Engine Enhancements:**
   - Update the plotting module (e.g., the scatter plot feature) to allow overlaying of cluster boundaries and color-coding different data groups.
   - Provide options to visually highlight clusters via custom themes or specific rendering options.

4. **Web Interface Integration:**
   - Add clustering options to the web interface, enabling interactive selection of the clustering algorithm and parameter tuning.
   - Include real-time previews so that users can see the impact of clustering adjustments before finalizing the plot.

5. **Testing and Documentation:**
   - Develop unit and integration tests to ensure that clustering parameters are correctly parsed and that cluster outputs are accurately represented on plots.
   - Update the README and CONTRIBUTING documentation with usage examples and troubleshooting guidelines for the clustering feature.

## Usage
- **CLI Example:**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --import data.csv --filter "age>=30" --cluster kmeans:3 --plot "scatter:age,salary"
  ```
- **Web Interface Example:**
   - Navigate to the clustering section in the web interface, select the desired clustering algorithm, adjust parameters interactively, and view the updated plot with color-coded clusters.
