# PDF_EXPORT Feature Specification

## Description
This feature introduces the capability to export generated plots directly to PDF format. Users can create high-quality, shareable PDF documents from both CLI and web interface sessions. This allows for seamless integration into reports, presentations, and archival systems, enhancing the versatility of the plotting tool.

## Motivation
- **High-Quality Output**: PDF files provide scalable, vector-based plots ideal for printing and professional presentations.
- **Enhanced Reporting**: Enables users to directly include plots in documents without requiring additional conversion steps.
- **Mission Alignment**: Supports our mission to be the go-to plot library with a comprehensive set of output formats by adding a widely-used, publication-ready format.

## Implementation Details
1. **CLI Integration:**
   - Introduce a new flag (e.g., `--export-pdf`) to specify that the output should be a PDF file.
   - Allow users to provide an output file name (e.g., `output.pdf`) as part of the command-line arguments.
   - Leverage the existing plot rendering pipeline to generate an intermediate SVG or canvas output which will then be converted to PDF.

2. **PDF Conversion Engine:**
   - Integrate a PDF conversion library (such as `pdfkit` or another suitable Node.js package) to transform SVG/HTML canvas outputs into PDF format.
   - Ensure that the conversion preserves all plot elements, including annotations, themes, and styling.
   - Validate the conversion process with a set of unit and integration tests.

3. **Web Interface Integration:**
   - Add a button or option in the web interface allowing users to download the currently displayed plot as a PDF.
   - Provide real-time feedback or preview of the PDF output to ensure the exported document meets user expectations.

4. **Testing and Documentation:**
   - Develop comprehensive tests to check PDF generation under various scenarios, covering both CLI and web interfaces.
   - Update the README and CONTRIBUTING documentation with usage examples, installation instructions for any new dependencies, and troubleshooting tips.

## Usage
- **CLI Example:**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --export-pdf output.pdf "linear:column1,column2,-10,10,1"
  ```
- **Web Interface Example:**
   - Launch the web server and navigate to the plotting interface. After generating the plot, use the "Download as PDF" option to save the file.
