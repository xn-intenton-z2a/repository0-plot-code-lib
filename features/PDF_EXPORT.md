# PDF_EXPORT Feature

## Overview
This feature adds support for exporting plots as PDF files in addition to the existing SVG and PNG formats. The PDF output is generated by leveraging the existing SVG generation and using Sharp's PDF output capabilities. This empowers users to obtain print-ready, vector-based PDFs directly via the CLI, aligning with the mission of providing versatile plot generation tools.

## Implementation Details
- **Source File Changes**:
  - Update the main CLI parsing logic in `src/lib/main.js` to detect file extensions ending with `.pdf`.
  - When a `.pdf` file is requested, generate the SVG content as usual and then convert the SVG to PDF using the Sharp library (e.g., using `sharp(Buffer.from(svgContent)).toFormat('pdf').toBuffer()`).
  - Ensure any custom CLI parameters (such as dimensions, styles, labels, grid, tooltip, etc.) are preserved during PDF generation.

- **Testing**:
  - Update the unit test file (`tests/unit/main.test.js`) by adding tests that simulate providing a `.pdf` filename via the `--file` option. The tests should verify that the output is a Buffer representing a PDF file, similar to the PNG tests.

- **Documentation**:
  - Update the `README.md` file to include examples and instructions on generating PDF outputs, specifying the new supported file extension and any relevant usage notes.

## Compatibility and Value
This enhancement broadens the utility of the tool by catering to users who require PDF formats for high-quality document inclusion or printing. It maintains consistency with the overall design philosophy of flexibility and customizability as outlined in the mission and contributing guidelines.
