# ANIMATIONS Feature Specification

## Description
This feature introduces animation capabilities to our plotting tool. It enables users to generate animated visualizations that showcase dynamic transitions between plot states or evolving datasets. The animation module can produce outputs such as animated GIFs or HTML5 video embeds and can be integrated with both CLI and web interfaces to enhance data storytelling and analysis.

## Motivation
- **Dynamic Visual Feedback:** Allow users to see how data evolves over time or through parameter transitions, making it easier to understand complex patterns.
- **Enhanced User Experience:** Animations add an engaging dimension to visualizations, supporting the mission of being the go-to plot library for formula-based visualisations.
- **Broad Use Cases:** Useful for presentations, educational demos, and real-time data monitoring where static plots might not fully capture the nuances of change.

## Implementation Details
1. **CLI Integration:**
   - Introduce a new flag (e.g., `--animate`) that activates animation mode.
   - Allow users to specify animation parameters such as frame rate, duration, and output format (GIF, MP4, etc.) as part of the command line arguments.
   - Update the argument parser in `src/lib/main.js` to recognize animation-related options and validate them using the existing numeric validation routines.

2. **Animation Rendering Engine:**
   - Extend the current rendering pipeline to support the generation of sequential frames.
   - Integrate with available libraries (e.g., `gifencoder` for GIF creation or `ffmpeg` bindings) to compile frames into an animation.
   - For the web interface, leverage HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript animations to provide real-time animated previews.

3. **Customizability and Theming:**
   - Allow users to customize the style of the plot animations, including color transitions, easing functions, and frame interpolation.
   - Integrate configuration options in both CLI and configuration files so that default animation settings can be overridden.

4. **Testing and Documentation:**
   - Develop unit tests to cover the animation frame generation, parameter validations, and the final export output.
   - Update README, CONTRIBUTING, and API documentation with detailed usage examples and troubleshooting tips for animation-related issues.

## Usage
- **CLI Example:**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --animate --duration 5 --framerate 10 output.gif "sine:1,0,0,360,1"
  ```
- **Web Interface Example:**
  Launch the web server with animation mode enabled (e.g., a toggle in the UI) to preview and export animated plots.

This feature will add significant value to the tool by providing dynamic, captivating visualizations that can better communicate data changes and trends over time.
