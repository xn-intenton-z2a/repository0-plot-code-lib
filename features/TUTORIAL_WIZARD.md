# TUTORIAL_WIZARD Feature Specification

## Description
This feature introduces an interactive tutorial wizard designed to guide new and intermediate users through the plotting library's diverse functionalities. The wizard offers a step-by-step guided experience that covers both CLI commands and the web interface. It explains core concepts such as numeric parameter validation, advanced plotting, configuration management, and even integration with plugins and chat-driven issue generation. By providing real-time, hands-on examples and interactive prompts, TUTORIAL_WIZARD lowers the entry barrier and accelerates user adoption.

## Motivation
- **User Onboarding:** New users can quickly learn how to use the plotting tool through an engaging, self-paced tutorial that demonstrates various features including CLI usage, web interface interactions, and configuration options.
- **Enhanced Productivity:** By guiding users through complex commands and debugging common errors with interactive hints, the tutorial reduces learning curves and troubleshooting time.
- **Mission Alignment:** This feature solidifies our mission to be the go-to plotting library by empowering users with clear, interactive, and formula-based learning modules, complementing our extensive feature set.

## Implementation Details
1. **CLI Integration:**
   - Add a new CLI flag (e.g., `--tutorial`) that launches an interactive text-based wizard.
   - Use command-line prompts to guide users through a series of lessons covering topics like basic plot commands, advanced numeric parameter validation (including special tokens like 'NaN'), and error interpretation.
   - Offer inline examples and allow users to experiment by running sample commands directly from the tutorial session.

2. **Web Interface Integration:**
   - Integrate a dedicated tutorial section within the existing web interface where users can follow a visual, step-by-step guide.
   - Use a combination of interactive tooltips, modal dialogs, and embedded code examples to illustrate different features.
   - Provide options to replay lessons or jump directly to specific topics (e.g., advanced plotting, configuration management, batch processing).

3. **Content Management and Contextual Help:**
   - Curate the tutorial content to be modular and context-aware, drawing on existing documentation such as README, CONTRIBUTING, and MISSION for consistency.
   - Allow users to request additional explanations or view detailed examples whenever they encounter complex commands or unexpected errors.

4. **Testing and Documentation:**
   - Develop unit and integration tests to simulate user interactions in both CLI and web environments, ensuring that tutorial steps provide correct guidance and feedback.
   - Update project documentation to include a section on how to access and utilize the TUTORIAL_WIZARD, with usage examples and troubleshooting tips.

## Usage
- **CLI Example:**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --tutorial
  ```
- **Web Interface Example:**
  - Launch the web server using `npm run start:web`.
  - Navigate to the tutorial section on the homepage to start a guided, interactive learning session.
