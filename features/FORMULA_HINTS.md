# FORMULA_HINTS Feature Specification (Enhanced with Context-Aware Suggestions and Auto-Correction)

## Overview
This feature refines the smart formula validation and suggestion mechanism by incorporating both context-aware hints and an optional auto-correction mode. It continues to intercept and analyze formula parse errors, considering user history and custom function definitions, while now offering an automated correction option for common and obvious mistakes. This extension remains aligned with our mission by reducing user error and enhancing the plotting workflow.

## Enhanced Suggestion Engine
- **Context-Aware Analysis:** Leverages string similarity measures (e.g., Levenshtein distance) combined with analysis of user history and patterns to provide highly relevant suggestions.
- **Custom Function Support:** Enables users to extend valid function names through configuration files or CLI flags, ensuring that personal customizations are respected.
- **Dynamic Guidance:** Offers suggestions that include links to documentation, usage examples, and troubleshooting tips, making the process educational.

## Auto-Correction Mode
- **Optional Auto-Correction:** Introduces a new CLI flag (e.g., `--autocorrect`) to automatically adjust minor errors in formulas based on context and common patterns.
- **Safety Net:** Before applying corrections, the system presents a preview of the auto-corrected formula and logs the changes, allowing users to accept or review the modifications.
- **Control and Customization:** Users can configure the sensitivity and scope of auto-corrections through parameter settings, ensuring that critical formulas arenâ€™t altered unexpectedly.

## Integration with Existing Systems
- **CLI and Library API:** The update remains fully integrated with both the CLI (via `src/lib/main.js`) and the library API (`validateFormula(formula)`), meaning that error messages now optionally include corrected formula suggestions.
- **History Manager Integration:** Auto-correction feedback and the original input are recorded in the HISTORY_MANAGER for transparency and retraceability.
- **Documentation Sync:** README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md are updated to explain the new `--autocorrect` flag, including examples of corrected outputs and configuration options.

## Testing & Adaptability
- **Unit Testing:** Expanded test cases to cover various error scenarios, validating that the auto-correction mode only modifies safe, common mistakes while preserving user intent.
- **User Feedback Loop:** Monitors user responses to auto-corrections and integrates adaptive learning for future improvements.

## Benefits
- **Reduced Friction:** The auto-correction option enables faster correction of minor typographical or syntax errors, minimizing interruption in the plotting workflow.
- **Enhanced Accuracy:** By coupling hints with automatic corrections, the feature both educates users on proper formula syntax and reduces errors in plotting commands.
- **Improved User Experience:** Leveraging context-aware analysis from past interactions, the system becomes increasingly better at predicting and fixing errors over time.

## Summary
This upgraded FORMULA_HINTS feature not only provides intelligent, context-based suggestions but also offers an optional auto-correction mode. This enhancement is designed to help users quickly fix common errors, seamlessly integrating with history management and the CLI experience while staying true to our mission of being the go-to plot library for formula visualisations.
