# CLI_ASSIST Feature

## Overview
This feature provides an interactive command-line assistant that guides users through plot configuration, interactive help, and now supports batch processing of plot commands. It builds on the existing CLI wizard, enhanced error correction, and ASCII preview mode. With the addition of batch processing, users can run multiple plot configurations sequentially from a specified file, streamlining workflows for automated or repetitive tasks.

## Interactive Wizard and ASCII Preview (Existing)
- **Interactive Wizard:**
  - Guides users step-by-step through plot configuration using the `--assist` flag.
  - Integrates advanced numeric validation and contextual help.

- **ASCII Preview Mode:**
  - Introduces an option (e.g., `--preview`) to render the plot layout as ASCII art, enabling rapid visual checks before full plot generation.

- **Enhanced Error Correction:**
  - Provides dynamic error suggestions and detailed logs when encountering input validation errors.

## Batch Processing Mode
- **Overview:**
  - Introduces a new mode that allows users to process multiple plot commands provided through a text file.
  - The batch mode is activated via a new flag (e.g., `--batch <filepath>`).

- **Implementation Details:**
  - **File Parsing:** The system will read a supplied text file where each line represents a separate plot command. Commands follow the existing colon-separated or JSON configuration formats.
  - **Command Processing:** Each line will be processed sequentially using the established numeric parsing and CLI assistant logic. Errors in one command will be handled gracefully, allowing the batch process to continue or report all errors at the end.
  - **Integration:** Utilizes the same utility functions (e.g., `parseNumericParams`) for consistency and ensures that advanced validation (including support for localized NaN aliases) is maintained.

- **Benefits:**
  - **Automation:** Enables users to automate multiple plot configurations without manual intervention for each command.
  - **Efficiency:** Ideal for batch generation of plots for reporting, testing, or data analysis tasks.
  - **Consistency:** Leverages existing CLI wizard capabilities, error handling, and ASCII preview to maintain a unified user experience.

## Integration and Testing
- **Backward Compatibility:**
  - Maintains full compatibility with previous CLI operations. Existing commands remain unchanged when batch mode is not used.
- **Testing:**
  - Extend unit tests to cover batch file parsing, ensuring each command is processed correctly and error scenarios are properly handled.
  - Include integration tests to simulate batch processing of multiple plot commands.

## Future Enhancements
- Consider adding options for parallel processing of commands, configurable error handling, and detailed batch process logging.

This update reinforces our mission to offer accessible plot visualizations by expanding the CLI tool to support both interactive and batch-based workflows.
