# CLI_ASSIST Feature

## Overview
This feature merges the traditional CLI help system with an interactive wizard mode to create a comprehensive command-line assistant. It guides users through plot configuration, parameter entry, and troubleshooting in a step-by-step manner. The CLI assistant offers contextual help messages and interactive prompts instead of static information, making the plotting tool more user-friendly and accessible for both novice and advanced users.

## Implementation Details
- **Interactive Wizard Integration:** Enhance the existing help system to include an interactive mode triggered by a new flag (e.g., `--assist`). In this mode, users are walked through configuring plots using prompts and on-screen instructions.
- **Contextual Assistance:** Merge static help (triggered by `--help`) with dynamic assistance where suggestions and parameter validations are provided in real-time based on user input. The system will detect and respond to invalid inputs with guided corrections.
- **Wizard Flow:** Design a sequential interactive flow that covers plot selection, numeric parameter input (leveraging the robust numeric validation from CORE_ENGINE), and an overview of export options. Use clear messaging to encourage best practices outlined in README and CONTRIBUTING guidelines.
- **Integration:** Update the main CLI module (`src/lib/main.js`) to incorporate the wizard mode seamlessly. Ensure that the interactive prompts do not conflict with existing parameter parsing logic.
- **Testing:** Extend unit tests to simulate interactive CLI sessions and verify that the wizard properly validates inputs, handles errors with custom callbacks, and provides clear instructions as per the mission of the library.

## Benefits
- **Improved User Engagement:** Offers a guided experience maximizing user comprehension when configuring plots, reducing the learning curve.
- **Consistency:** Consolidates help and interactive validation into one unified assistant, maintaining consistency with the library's core functionalities.
- **Maintains Mission Alignment:** Supports the mission to "be the go-to plot library" by ensuring accessibility and ease-of-use via both automated help and interactive configuration.
