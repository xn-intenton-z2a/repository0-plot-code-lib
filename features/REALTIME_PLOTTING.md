# REALTIME_PLOTTING Feature Specification

## Description
This feature introduces real-time plotting capabilities to our library. With real-time plotting, users can stream data continuously and see dynamic, live-updating visualizations. This mode is ideal for time-series data, sensor outputs, or any application requiring immediate visual feedback from incoming data streams.

## Motivation
- **Immediate Feedback:** Enables users to monitor data as it is generated, providing instant insights into trends and anomalies.
- **Enhanced Engagement:** Live visualizations improve user experience by interacting dynamically with data.
- **Mission Alignment:** By supporting real-time updates, we further our mission of being the go-to tool for versatile and innovative formula visualizations.

## Implementation Details
1. **CLI Integration:**
   - Introduce a new CLI flag (e.g., `--live`) to activate real-time plotting mode.
   - Accept additional parameters for specifying the data source (e.g., a WebSocket URL or data stream endpoint).

2. **Data Streaming and Validation:**
   - Integrate with a WebSocket server (or similar streaming API) to handle incoming data.
   - Validate streamed data using existing numeric validation routines and ensure that data points are appropriately timestamped and ordered.

3. **Rendering and Update Mechanism:**
   - Extend the current rendering engine to refresh plots in real time. Use incremental updates to avoid re-rendering the entire plot with each new data point.
   - Support multiple output formats. For web-based outputs (HTML/SVG), ensure smooth transitions and animations between updates.

4. **Configuration and Error Handling:**
   - Allow configuration of refresh rates, buffer sizes, and timeout values either via CLI flags or configuration files.
   - Include robust error handling to manage interruptions in the data stream, such as reconnecting logic and informative user messages.

5. **Testing and Documentation:**
   - Add unit and integration tests for live data streaming, ensuring that the plotting engine correctly updates on new incoming data.
   - Update the README and CONTRIBUTING guides with clear usage examples and troubleshooting tips for real-time plotting.

## Usage
- **Basic Real-Time Plotting Mode:**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --live ws://localhost:4000/data output.svg "live:data"
  ```

- **Using with Web Interface:**
  Launch the web interface with real-time updates enabled, which will allow multiple clients to view a live-updating plot.

This feature transforms static plotting into an interactive, real-time visualization tool, making our library more versatile and better suited for dynamic data analysis.
