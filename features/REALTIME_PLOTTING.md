# REALTIME_PLOTTING Feature Specification

## Description
This feature introduces real-time plotting capabilities to the library, enabling live updates and dynamic visualization of continually streaming data. The REALTIME_PLOTTING module will allow users to monitor evolving datasets, simulate real-time scenarios, and integrate streaming data sources directly into the plotting tool. This feature is designed to work seamlessly with both the CLI and the web interface for interactive sessions.

## Motivation
- **Dynamic Data Monitoring:** In many practical scenarios such as IoT, financial markets, or system performance monitoring, data is continuously updated. This feature will dramatically enhance the utility of the library in such environments.
- **Mission Alignment:** By providing live plotting, the tool reinforces its mission to be the go-to plot library for real-time and formula-based visualisations, offering a more comprehensive analytical suite.
- **Enhanced User Experience:** Users can observe immediate visual feedback from their data streams, speeding up troubleshooting, iterative analysis, and decision-making processes.

## Implementation Details
1. **CLI Integration:**
   - Introduce a new CLI flag (e.g., `--realtime`) to activate the real-time plotting mode.
   - Allow users to specify a data source (e.g., a file that is continuously updated, a network socket, or a simulated data stream) via command-line arguments.

2. **Data Streaming and Processing:**
   - Integrate a lightweight streaming parser to read continuously incoming data.
   - Utilize existing numeric validations to ensure data integrity and compatibility with the rendering engine.
   - Implement buffering and throttling mechanisms to handle rapid data updates without overwhelming the rendering pipeline.

3. **Rendering Engine Enhancements:**
   - Extend the current rendering pipeline to support incremental updates, redrawing only the changed portions of the plot.
   - Support multiple output formats (SVG, PNG, ASCII) with considerations for dynamic refresh.

4. **Web Interface Compatibility:**
   - Integrate with the existing web interface to provide a live-updating dashboard using WebSockets or server-sent events (SSE).
   - Develop a minimal front-end component for real-time visual feedback, including auto-refresh and pause/resume controls.

5. **Testing and Documentation:**
   - Add unit and integration tests simulating both static and streaming data inputs, verifying the robustness of the real-time updates.
   - Update the README and CONTRIBUTING documentation with detailed usage examples, configuration guidelines, and troubleshooting tips specific to real-time plotting.

## Usage
- **CLI Example:**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --realtime dataStreamEndpoint "sine:1,0,0,360,1"
  ```
- **Web Interface Example:**
  Launch the web server with real-time mode enabled:
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --serve --realtime
  ```
  Then navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view live updating plots.

This feature bridges the gap between static data analysis and dynamic, real-time visualization, further solidifying the libraryâ€™s role as the essential tool for monitoring and interpreting evolving data.
