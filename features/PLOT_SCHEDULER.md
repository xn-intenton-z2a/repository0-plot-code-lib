# PLOT_SCHEDULER Feature Specification

## Description
This feature introduces scheduling capabilities into the plotting tool. Users will be able to schedule automated plot generation and export at regular intervals, enabling dynamic reporting and continuous monitoring of evolving datasets. Whether invoked via the CLI or managed through the web interface, PLOT_SCHEDULER provides a robust mechanism to ensure that visual insights are delivered on time without manual intervention.

## Motivation
- **Automated Reporting:** Automatically generate plots at specified intervals for regular reporting, dashboards, or data monitoring.
- **Workflow Efficiency:** Reduce manual effort by automating plot generation, making the tool more scalable for recurring tasks.
- **Mission Alignment:** Enhances our library's goal of being the go-to tool for formula-based visualisations by introducing advanced automation, similar to how jq automates data querying.

## Implementation Details
1. **CLI Integration:**
   - Introduce a new flag (e.g., `--schedule`) that accepts scheduling parameters in cron-like syntax or as interval values.
   - Allow users to define output settings such as output format, file destination, and optional notification parameters (e.g., email alerts upon plot generation).

2. **Web Interface Integration:**
   - Add a dedicated scheduling panel where users can set up, view, and manage scheduled plotting tasks.
   - Provide real-time status updates and logs for each scheduled task with options to pause, edit, or cancel the schedule.

3. **Scheduling Engine:**
   - Integrate a scheduling library (e.g., `node-cron`) to execute plotting commands at the defined intervals.
   - Ensure seamless interaction with the existing rendering pipeline to generate plots according to the specified parameters and handle errors gracefully.

4. **Testing and Documentation:**
   - Develop unit and integration tests to simulate scheduled tasks, verifying that plots are generated accurately and on time.
   - Update the README and CONTRIBUTING guidelines with configuration examples, troubleshooting tips, and best practices for scheduling automated plot generation.

## Usage
- **CLI Example:**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --schedule "*/30 * * * *" output.svg "linear:column1,column2,-10,10,1"
  ```

- **Web Interface Example:**
   - Launch the web server and navigate to the scheduling section.
   - Configure the desired plot type, output settings, and schedule frequency, then activate the schedule to automatically generate updated plots at the defined intervals.
