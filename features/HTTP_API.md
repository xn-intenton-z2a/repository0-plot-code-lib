# HTTP_API Feature Specification

## Overview
This feature introduces a lightweight HTTP API server to provide programmatic access to the plotting libraryâ€™s core functionalities. By offering HTTP endpoints, users and integrated systems can generate plots, retrieve history records, and perform dry-run simulations remotely. This API complements the CLI interface and library usage, aligning with our mission to be the go-to plot library for formula visualisations.

## Implementation Details
### Express Server Setup
- **Server Initialization:** Utilize the existing Express dependency to create a minimal HTTP server within a single source file (e.g., `src/lib/httpApi.js`).
- **Configuration:** Allow configuration of the server port via environment variables or command-line arguments.

### Endpoints
- **GET /plot**
  - Accepts query parameters such as `formula`, `interval`, `step`, `color`, etc.
  - Leverages the plotting engine to generate and return a colorized ASCII plot.
- **POST /plot**
  - Accepts a JSON payload containing plot parameters.
  - Returns the computed plot and diagnostic details in JSON format.
- **GET /history**
  - Integrates with the HISTORY_MANAGER to fetch and filter plot history records.
- **Additional Endpoints:**
  - Endpoints for dry-run simulation, clearing history, and more can be added as needed to mirror CLI functionalities.

### Integration & Validation
- **Reuse Validation Logic:** Incorporate the robust argument and payload validation (originally in ARG_VALIDATION, now merged into CLI_INTERFACE) using Zod schemas to ensure correct parameter formats.
- **Error Handling:** Return clear HTTP error statuses and messages for invalid inputs, following consistent messaging as in the CLI.
- **Logging & Monitoring:** Integrate with the SYSTEM_MONITORING feature to log API usage and errors.

## Testing and Documentation
- **Tests:** Add unit and integration tests for each endpoint using existing test frameworks (e.g., vitest) to verify expected behavior and error handling.
- **Documentation Updates:** Update README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md with detailed API usage examples, endpoint descriptions, and deployment instructions.

## Benefits
- **Programmatic Access:** Enables external systems to trigger plotting operations seamlessly via HTTP, promoting automation and integration.
- **Consistency:** Provides a unified interface with similar validation, logging, and error management as the CLI, enhancing user experience across interfaces.
- **Flexibility:** Serves as an alternative access layer, increasing the versatility of the repository by making its core functionalities available as a service.
