# HTTP_API Feature Specification (Enhanced with Health Checks and System Monitoring)

## Overview
This feature introduces a lightweight HTTP API server that not only provides programmatic access to the plotting libraryâ€™s core functionalities but also integrates comprehensive system monitoring, unified error handling, and external log streaming. By consolidating API endpoints and diagnostic capabilities, this feature enhances operational insight while remaining aligned with our mission to be the go-to plot library for formula visualisations.

## Express Server Setup
- **Server Initialization:** Utilize the existing Express dependency to create a minimal HTTP server within a single source file (e.g., `src/lib/httpApi.js`).
- **Configuration:** Allow configuration of the server port and monitoring parameters via environment variables or command-line arguments.

## Endpoints
- **GET /plot**
  - Accepts query parameters such as `formula`, `interval`, `step`, `color`, etc.
  - Leverages the plotting engine to generate and return a colorized ASCII plot.
- **POST /plot**
  - Accepts a JSON payload containing plot parameters.
  - Returns the computed plot and diagnostic details in JSON format.
- **GET /history**
  - Integrates with the unified history manager to fetch and filter plot history records.
- **Health Check Endpoint - GET /health**
  - Returns a JSON response with status information including uptime, memory usage, and general service health.
  - Provides diagnostics that pull in performance metrics and environment details.

## Monitoring and Diagnostics Integration
- **Unified Error Handling:**
  - Implements centralized error capture across the HTTP API endpoints, ensuring that any unhandled errors are logged with descriptive, consistent messages.
  - In debug mode, detailed stack traces are provided.
- **Performance and Environment Metrics:**
  - Uses high-resolution timers to measure execution time and resource usage.
  - Retrieves key environment details such as Node version and dependency versions.
- **External Log Streaming:**
  - Provides an optional module to stream real-time log events to external monitoring services (e.g., Logstash, Fluentd) or custom endpoints.
  - Includes fallback mechanisms to archive logs locally if streaming issues occur.

## Integration & Validation
- **Validation Logic Reuse:** Incorporates robust argument and payload validation (using Zod schemas) ensuring correct parameter formats across endpoints.
- **Error Handling & Logging:** Uses middleware to handle errors uniformly and log API usage, performance data, and diagnostic events.
- **Configuration Flexibility:** Monitoring settings and external log streaming configurations are customizable via environment variables and configuration files.

## Testing and Documentation
- **Unit and Integration Tests:**
  - Tests cover each endpoint, including health checks and error handling as well as simulated external log streaming scenarios.
- **Documentation Updates:**
  - README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md are updated with API usage examples, endpoint details, and configuration instructions for monitoring features.

## Benefits
- **Unified Access and Monitoring:** Provides both regular plotting operations and integrated system diagnostics from a single HTTP interface.
- **Operational Insight:** The health check endpoint and performance logging offer vital diagnostic data and support for container orchestration and monitoring tools.
- **Enhanced Reliability:** Centralized error handling and external log streaming improve the detection and resolution of issues in real time.

## Summary
This enhanced HTTP_API feature consolidates core plotting endpoints with comprehensive system monitoring. The result is a robust, easily monitored API that serves both client requests and operational diagnostic needs, fully supporting our mission of being the go-to plot library for formula visualisations.
