# Node.js Core APIs, Streams, and Concurrency
## https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html
## https://nodejs.org/api/worker_threads.html
## https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html
## https://nodejs.org/api/perf_hooks.html
Comprehensive reference covering filesystem operations, low-level and high-level stream APIs (Readable, Writable, Transform), backpressure, object mode, promise-based utilities (fs/promises, pipeline, finished, async iteration), Performance Hooks API (PerformanceObserver, mark/measure), and concurrency primitives via Worker Threads and child processes. Crucial for building non-blocking CLI commands, high-throughput batch plotting, file-backed caching, precision benchmarking, and isolating CPU-intensive tasks.
