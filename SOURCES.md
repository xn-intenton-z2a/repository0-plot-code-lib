# Node.js Core I/O, Streams, Stream Promises, and Performance Hooks Documentation
## https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html
## https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html
## https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_promises
## https://nodejs.org/api/perf_hooks.html
Comprehensive reference covering filesystem operations (fs, fs/promises with AbortSignal support), low-level and high-level stream APIs (Readable, Writable, Transform, backpressure, object mode), the Promise-based stream utilities (pipeline, finished, async iteration), and the Performance Hooks API (PerformanceObserver, mark/measure, event loop timings). Enhanced with practical examples on backpressure-aware JSON handling, integrating JSONStream patterns directly into Node.js streams, and tuning pipeline concurrency. Essential for implementing serializeDataStream, NDJSON record streaming, file-backed caches, and precise benchmarking in the --benchmark feature.

# CLI Tools & Validation: Zod and Yargs
## https://zod.dev
## https://github.com/yargs/yargs#readme
Integrated guide for schema-based validation (Zod) and advanced CLI parsing (Yargs). Zod covers schema creation, parsing pipelines, type inference, asynchronous refinements, custom error formatting, and complex nested validations—critical for robust CLI flag validation and config parsing. Yargs provides declarative command modules, positional arguments, type coercion, middleware hooks, localized help generation, and async command handlers—key for orchestrating subcommands and extensible argument parsing.
Both projects are actively maintained (Zod v3.x, Yargs v20.x) and licensed under MIT.
